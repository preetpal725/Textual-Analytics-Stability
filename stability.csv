Our conservative management of the balance sheet provides sufficient headroom to manage unforeseen headwinds and supports strong investment grade credit ratings, which enable us to fund our capital plan cost efficiently to the benefit of customers and investors."
1,"7 billion of so-called asset that we have acquired through the various vehicles and various joint ventures, and this hasn't even included the Golden Shoe Car Park. Number two, I think we have strengthened our stable recurring income base. If you look at our current portfolio, on an effective state basis, this is on accounting view of our portfolio having consolidated CMT and CRCT and as well as the rest of the REITs, but if you look at it on an effective state basis, we have about 80% of our capital in our investment property and about 20% in residential trading."
1,"7 billion on a rolling 12 month basis. Our contract win rate remains broadly stable, but we are seeing both the size and duration of new contracts reduce. One area to call out is our security services where we continue to see strong growth."
1,7 billion. Increasing our dividend by 87% versus the prior quarter and nearly tripling it versus the fourth quarter of 2016 based on our strong balance sheet and steady production profile and being recognized as an industry leader for our sustainability performance. I'll expand on that topic on slide 5.
1,"7 million a lot of that expansion opportunity it's a nice balance from those other post-acute or pre-acute settings. And so, I would say they're kind of a steady integrated opportunity in the way we think of our market opportunity."
1,"7 million. The fair value uplifts are primarily due to an increase in net operating income, with our overall weighted average portfolio cap rate remaining stable at 6. 47%."
1,7 times EBITDA which gives us a very strong balance sheet moving forward. Our largest business Fuel Specialties continued its steady growth. Profitability was in our expected range although it was slightly down on a very strong quarter last year.
1,7 times. Our credit ratings from both S&P and Moody's remain unchanged during the half with S&P revising their outlook for the group from negative to stable in September last year. I'll now turn to slide 16 and the dividend.
1,7% last year. We also maintain our guidance for stable underlying operating profit margin at 6. 5%.
1,"7%. And you can see some good performances on many brands, with the strengthening of some of our stronger brands and the good performance of our growth relays, Absolut and Lillet growing significantly their market share, Ramazzotti being stable and Havana Club, in a more competitive rum market, losing a little bit. But you see the good performances of our growth relays; Jameson up 14% over the first half; Monkey up 50% in what is the whole market of Monkey 47; and the whole Prestige range, as I just said, growing by 16%."
1,7%. Our full year market share was stable. The combined GÃ©ant and Cdiscount nonfood sales grew plus 4.
1,"70 million plus customers compared to 130 million plus customers at Verizon and AT&T. And when you run the math about the leverage of growth and the unlock of a fixed cost in a highly capital intensive business, we can create much more value by executing to a stable ARPU environment versus employing a strategy of monetizing ARPU, which will slow down our growth, which will slow down the margin unlock that we get with the organic scale of the business. So, we are very much executing a strategy and we're the only carrier in the U."
1,"8 billion of cash at the end of the year, of which about $2 billion of that was offshore. And we've maintained a steady level of debt so that our overall debt and capital position has been improving in the last couple of years. So we have a strong balance sheet that we can start 2018 with."
1,"8 million in cash after transaction costs. Lastly, turning to the rental operations segment of our business, this segment is not only a steady contributor to our operating results, but is an important component that helps us maintain a consistent supply of labor for our agribusiness operations via our workforce housing units, which encompass the majority of our tenants. Our rental units averaged near full occupancy and should continue to be a consistent source of positive cash flow for the company going forward."
1,"8 million or 43% of EBITDA. Return on invested capital, or what we call ROIC, remained stable and strong at 18% and continues to be above our cost of capital, but it does reflect our dampened profitability levels, and we expect this to improve as margins grow. On August 29, we closed on a new debt structure and announced a new $85 million ABL credit facility and $250 million Term Loan B, as you all know."
1,"8 years, slightly down reflecting no new funding arrangements during the half. Our credit ratings remained unchanged at A and A2 for Standard & Poor's and Moody's respectively, both with stable outlooks. So, in summary it's been another positive period through 31 December."
1,"8% and 18 of these facilities received a perfect accreditation score of 100%. Looking at our state segment, our eight state correctional customers have stable budgets and our facilities have been able to provide high quality services without being impacted by budgetary constraints. Across these eight state customers, we have been expanding the delivery of our GEO Continuum of Care programs which have now been launched at 14 GEO state correctional facilities."
1,8% in the same period last year. We continue to deliver sequential stable underlying margins as a result of strong execution and good momentum on our continuous efficiency improvement program. Fourth quarter depreciation was down from last year at NOK 353 million.
1,"8% to 1. 9% range for eight straight years, a remarkable result that highlights our strong value proposition and steady execution. New car conversions in the fourth quarter were roughly flat as you would expect."
1,"85 billion or 9% of sales. In terms of investments, our portfolio of opportunities to be decided in the next 12 months is pretty stable at â‚¬2. 1 billion, with a little more 40% of the opportunities being in Americas."
1,"9 million as of December 31, 2016. This stable level of cash was mainly explained by our decision to practically self-fund for the time being M&A transactions, including earn-outs and CapEx, to expand our offices in Latin America, U. S."
1,"9 million. Our consolidated gross margin was stable at 22. 4% when compared to the same period in fiscal 2017, while gross margin on product and services decreased by 30 basis points to 20."
1,"9% in the prior quarter and 35% in the same quarter last year. This record gross margin level is a result of the stable ASP environment combined with continued cost reduction initiative that lower our product manufacturing cost. As was anticipated, we spent more on air shipment in order to accommodate increased product demand and industry-wide component availability issues."
1,"9% last year. As Joss mentioned in his remarks, we are very pleased with our adjusted EBITDA margins highlighting our steady improvement towards our long-term target of 30% plus. Adjusted earnings for the quarter was ZAR 0."
1,9% we achieved last year. And our last market South Florida ranks as a C+ with a stable outlook. We began to see weakness in our South Florida portfolio during 2017 and the economic outlook for 2018 calls for deceleration in job growth this year.
1,"9%, benefiting from the strong increase in equity markets over 2017. The investment mix and the credit quality of our bond portfolio has remained stable over time with an average credit rating of A. Taken together, this demonstrates the high quality nature of our investment portfolio."
1,"9%, reflecting an improved trend over the previous quarter. We maintained a steady pace of expansion in Q4 in terms of square footage, and we continue to see a positive impact from our acquisitions of Eroski in Spain and BILLA in Romania. Please note that as of the first quarter of 2018, these acquisitions will start integrating our like-for-like as the cycle of our full 12 months in our scope."
1,"A good question because Triad is like a forward integration with our Radiopharmaceutical business and Triad helps us to go directly to the hospitals and the patients to meet the needs of the hospital and the patients. So we're closer to the patient, at the same time, it provides us an opportunity to expand in our Radiopharmaceutical business, with expansion it further increases our base for meeting the direct needs of the customer and also it provides us a stable   provides it more stability by directly reaching to the customer of our Radiopharmaceutical business."
1,"A question also related to the Homes business, you show that ARPU has been very stable or even growing on that part. And I'm just wondering in your guidance for 2018, where do you foresee Homes ARPU going, will it be stable at this level or do you foresee an increase or even a decrease? And then just a second question if I may to you Tim on the financial expenses given that you increased the share of tower leases now, how you foresee financial expenses for 2018?"
1,"A significant portion of our leasing has come from existing tenants that have extended their leases and in some cases, expanded their footprint in the building which has served to substantially reduce much of the near-term role. At 50 Beale, we made steady progress during the fourth quarter. We ended the year at 82."
1,"A, they don't have that capacity. And B, they don't have the steady source of customer relationship referrals we get from a bank. So we're actually very, very excited about this and we think 8% to 10% is good revenue growth, which will probably maybe jump off before we have an acquisition."
1,"About CHF 3 million in revenue, a small anatomical pathology business that's being completely folded into our business in Zurich called Medica. The regulatory environment in Switzerland is stable and I guess I could make a summary statement about Switzerland that our operations are performing exceptionally well. Slide 12, UK and Ireland, 5% organic revenue growth; 6% organic revenue growth, if we normalize for the working days."
1,"Across the sub-segments within the Jackpotjoy segment, 2017 as a whole was pretty consistent with previous years. Steady, consistent growth in Jackpotjoy UK, our flagship brand. Although TV campaigns have long tails and long payback periods, we're very happy with the results to date of our Paddy McGuinness campaigns with respect to first time depositors and total brand awareness."
1,"Activity in the quarter included a large new C&I client as well as several new CRE loans in the expanding urban core of the region. The KC team continues to gain momentum and pipelines are benefiting from new talent, steady economic growth and traction in our brand in this market. In Arizona, we also experienced double-digit loan growth in 2017 as well as a strong Q4."
1,"Add to the federal rate you end up in the mid to high-20s. With respect to pricing, our pricing has been really pretty stable. We have a number of longer term agreements within our Reagent rental agreements that we're not finding ourselves having to discount further."
1,"Adjusted free cash flow to G&W before new business investments and grant funded projects is estimated to be $370 million, which is a 37% increase year-over-year. As a side note, our cash tax rate is expected to be approximately 13% or roughly one-half our book tax rate, and we expect this cash tax rate to remain stable for the next five years, underpinning our strong free cash flow. Now let's move to slide 17, and an overview of the operating segments starting with North America."
1,"Adjusted operating income excluding restructuring charges was 8% to US$121. 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the adjusted operating income margin was steady at 31% of adjusted sales compared to the same period in 2016. For the full-year, adjusted operating income rose 14% to US$371."
1,"Adjusting for the non-recurring industry sales during 2016, yearly cement volumes declined by 1%. On a like-to-like basis, our cement prices remained stable sequentially. The British Treasury recently released its autumn budget with an ambitious plan to improve productivity through an increase in public investment."
1,Aegion's actions in 2017 simplify and position our company to deliver stable long-term earnings growth. Our focus is on market opportunities with favorable earnings profiles.
1,"Again the other piece of it is kind of a long-term operational model. If you have good stable markets, you're able to target your capacity to the better returning segments. And so each quarter that goes by, you get a little better richer mix in your factories."
1,"Again, the low taxes for the full year giving us a net profit of $41 million for the whole year. Balance sheet development I think is a messy slide, but you can see towards your left that equity has increased and the balance sheet in total is more or less quite stable, which gives a higher percentage on the equity ratio, of course. And you can also see quite low net interest-bearing debt."
1,"Again, there's things like, you'll have higher payroll taxes in Q1 but you have lower incentive comp typically in Q1 which we match with our earnings by quarter. So again, I would expect that SG&A to be pretty stable over the course of 2018."
1,"Again, we expect further growth of these assets that have been repositioned as we capitalize on the small shop lease-up not included in our original returns. Our shadow pipeline highlighted in the supplement also continues to grow as we make steady progress towards our target of $150 million to $200 million of annual spend in delivery, which we expect to reach at the end of this year. As we discussed at our Investor Day, each of these new projects such as Beneva Village in Sarasota, Braes Heights in Houston or Mamaroneck Center in Westchester, moves us towards our purpose of being the center of the communities we serve."
1,"Against that backdrop, I'd like to mention some highlights though from today's results. We delivered higher income, cost discipline and balance sheet strength while managing steady progress towards our strategic and operational goals. Profit before tax of Â£1."
1,"All of these partners would be deploying our Wave 3 10G product. With this program now in steady motion, it paves the way for further design win, as well as a faster deployment of our existing design win. Thus, our current expectation is that our Wave 3 10G revenue should grow incrementally from the current level as 2018 progresses."
1,"All of these transfers will take place during 2018. And so, in summary, the balance sheet is stable and well-capitalized, the group continues to maintain a robust funding and liquidity position, and our business remains strongly capital generative. Douglas, back to you."
1,"All of this leads to attractive pro forma volume growth and even more attractive cash flow growth as we have shown on slide 8. Steady volume and cash flow growth is expected over the next two years, driven by the strength of our U. S."
1,"All the data here now is reflected as actuals. We closed our 2017 and you can see the results and you can see again, this is a company that's had a history of steady performance. We're in markets that can be a bit volatile, but we have a very, very diverse position."
1,All the names you just mentioned including all the other Top 10 have been pretty steady over the course of the last several quarters. Everybody is dealing with labor pressures and everybody is dealing with the issues in different given markets.
1,"All-in, a positive set of facts, but too early to call 2019, although UDR will benefit from an improving NOI contribution from our recent development completions, which total approximately $500 million in capital invested. Moving on, we discontinued publishing our two-year outlook, given our stable outlook, a consistent strategic direction that we have executed well upon over the last five years, our ongoing best-in-class disclosure, and both solicited and unsolicited feedback from our shareholder base. Moving forward, we will continue to openly discuss our strategic direction with market participants."
1,"Also ARPU is in line with our overall base ARPU after discounts, currently around Â£50 per month. And build cost   importantly, build cost to-date have been steady around the Â£650 per premise mark, with some variance depending on whether we're doing infill or greenfield, and, of course, that number will also vary going forward depending on the start-up CapEx, but also depending on the timing of wayleaves. Remember that in the denominator of that Â£650 premise mark, we don't include another 10% of homes that we've built but haven't yet released for marketing because of wayleaves."
1,"Although the market opportunity is still relatively small compared with front-end equipment, it does provide us with a significant opportunity for continued growth in this business, which has already become approximately 10% of our Semiconductor product revenue. Our outlook for this segment is for more steady growth in 2018, and certainly for more design wins with new and existing customers. As we'd guided, CCS revenue for the quarter came in just shy of $14 million, a decrease from September's $15 million and the third consecutive quarter of lower revenue, but still robust considering the lower level of Tier 1 foundry activity."
1,"And   but I did mention what we do expect is this more diverse market as we pursue continued growth. So we will see a continued and steady mix up at the highest end of our portfolio, but given different use cases and workloads, both technologically but also geographically, we do think we'll see a longer tail of shipments of the lower capacities as we referenced in this announcement of these mid-range products that we announced a week or so ago."
1,"And again we feel comfortable, we've worked with. I've spent quite a bit of time out in the field with our senior housing operators and we've seen some steady increases over the last quarter. So we feel like going into 2018 that they're set up for some good success."
1,"And also just the tag line with Hardwood Floors For Less! given that so much of your new product focus is on non-hardwood product, is there a way that you think you might be able to tweak the brand or have you decided just going to stay steady going forward?"
1,"And also, Elyse, what we said was that our PML relative to capital is about stable. So, we weren't suggesting that the PML would go down necessarily, but just relative to capital would be about in a similar position."
1,"And also, we have concluded a rights issue, which partially financed the Vindora acquisition, but the Vindora acquisition and the others were also financed with other funds. So, this has meant that our net debt in absolute terms has increased somewhat, but our leverage ratio remains at a fairly stable level of 2. 6 times following both these sort of transactions."
1,"And also, we see a growth in customer that we call do-it-for-me. That's of course customers who will engage in more discretionary products and wants a stable saving but don't want to spend a lot of time and effort in achieving the savings goals. So I think it's a lot about broaden the customer group but not losing focus on the intensive customers which has a built the ground of Avanza."
1,"And although our leverage ratio remains below our long-term target, this is in part driven by the sizable cash buffers we hold, which nonetheless does continue to be a drag on our profitability in the current rate environment. Our value-at-risk metrics, our loan-to-deposit ratio, our liquidity coverage and our stable funding levels all comfortably meet or exceed our targets. Credit loss provisioning in the year was at a cyclical low, and we did not see the level of litigation and regulatory settlement expense that has been a hallmark of recent prior years."
1,"And as a result of that effort, we secured the $50 million in contracts I just mentioned, and we have a pipeline of $10 million in new annualized opportunities that we hope to close on in the next couple of months. While there are limitations to the growth we can realize from this revenue category due to capacity, winning new customer contracts secures this revenue stream for the future and will keep it stable and allow for some small growth over the next several years, aiding our overall organic revenue growth story. Consumer revenue is our largest single revenue category which makes it crucial to our overall organic top line revenue growth prospects."
1,"And as a result of that, we have adjusted our capital program throughout the years, throughout 2016, throughout 2017 that resulted in some lumpiness in our quarter-by-quarter production. And our goal is to eliminate or take some of that volatility amplitude out of our production profile while we continue to improve year-over-year, but maintain a more steady approach. And we're in position in 2018 as we roll through the first quarter to do that and have a more predictable profile."
1,"And as Ludwin stated, the year has started with a very solid financial performance. In spite of more heavy headwinds from the currencies, we achieved good top line growth and stable operational profitability margins overall; and also both of our two strategic business units contributed to that. Let me start with the strategic business unit Ophthalmic Devices."
1,"And as we've said in our prepared comments, we expect that capital markets in particular to be helpful to our 3% to 6% growth in 2018. We do have   our service charges have been a very stable component of our non-interest revenue. We grew that about a little over 2%, almost 3% a year."
1,"And as you've heard me say before, we're great believers in this part of the strategy that revenue growth follows the pickup in user net adds, it's worked everywhere else and we're beginning to see it works in Colombia in mobile. And pricing in mobile in Colombia is much more stable than it was a year ago and you can clearly think of our ARPUs as being pretty stable in Colombia these days. And whereas we don't really give a lot of detail per segment, per country, we can certainly tell you that sequentially mobile B2C revenue in Colombia has been up the last few quarters and that's certainly very, very comforting for us."
1,"And basically all of our preclinical data to-date suggests that our antibody do not see the tetramer but do see anything else in terms of the misfolded and non-native forms. And so what we've done is we've used our stable of antibodies to build an assay to look in patient blood. And what that basically does is uses two antibodies, one is a capture antibody which specifically picks up these non-normal forms of TTR, and then we have detection or signaling antibodies that come in and actually signal off of that, and that gives us this nice signal which is quantifiable."
1,"And can you just talk about your approach to the buyback, Yifan, is it intended to be steady on a quarterly basis or more opportunistic based on a metrics approach to where greater amounts of repurchase activity if the stock tips lower. How should we think about the way you'll execute that buyback program?"
1,"And China is one of the best insurance markets around the world. About your question on agent force, well, if you know Ping An well, you can see   you know that actually, we always keep a steady pace for the whole year and we usually increase our agents in Q2 and Q3. And so, in some quarters, you may see smaller number of agents, but we do not just look at the short-term."
1,"And Dell EMC has completed the qualification phase for their EPYC-based systems, and we'll be sharing more on launch plans shortly. Our reentry into the server market remains on track with a steady ramp of new platforms and deployments across our OEM and hyperscale data center customers. Our Semi-Custom business performed as expected in the quarter, as unit shipments declined from a year ago as we completed the fifth year of the current game console cycle."
1,"And demand increasing, as I described to you for the last couple years and next year, also is pretty stable at 20% to 25% and are likely to maintain the same, okay. So, for the   your question especially, I will say, first half pretty much stable. Second half, let's wait and see if all the supplier really do what they say."
1,"And despite this, the company has been able to continue to grow. So, as we enter into the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, we've seen a quite a solid month of January and we hope that we will continue with this trend through the end of the fiscal year and the next fiscal year with a much, I would say, more stable operation."
1,"And finally, as I've mentioned, there are   the exchange rates have moved significantly in the last few months, and we expect exchange rate headwind of about 3% for the full year. Now, in terms of training   trading, sorry, our guidance for organic growth remains 5% to 7%, as we said in Q3, with stable margin. So at this point, I'll hand back to Nick who will cover the business strategy and the performance."
1,"And for hereditary cancer, we actually feel very good about how that business is performing overall. We've got four quarters in a row of year-over-year growth and stable pricing, and so when you put those two components together, that's a business, that's certainly a solid foundation and opportunity for significant continued improvement in that business. So, overall, I think we're very pleased with how the year has shaped up."
1,"And for those of you who have been in semiconductors a long time, our operational efficiencies and gross margin really are tied to utilization. And the better job we know of what our customers want a quarter from now, the better job we can do keeping that steady and that's a big deal. And so frankly, I think it's given us the opportunity to get closer to our customers and their long-term needs and do a little better job of guessing."
1,"and for us. In our ownership portfolio, which is at those levels of RevPAR growth given the way the cost base is growing, it gets difficult to grow margins, and so margins have been pretty stable. Overall owned and operated margins for us actually for 2017 were up, but most of that was driven by results outside the U."
1,"And hence that has reflected into a bit of a less revenue, but still a very healthy EBITDA and profitability, as you would be able to see from the numbers. Our EBITDA margins continue to remain stable at 26. 4% in this quarter due to our continued focus on niche molecules, which help us sustain profitability."
1,"And history would show that this leads to future opportunities for lending, depository, Treasury or other fee-based services as we are introduced into these companies. We continue to generate a steady flow and mix of new general C&I opportunities across our markets. Larger Q4 deals include a management buyout in the financial services sector, refinancing a new equipment in a large medical practice and expanded working capital in a growing transportation related business."
1,And I hope before we go to Q&A that you have a clear view of the breadth of the very diverse revenue growth opportunities we have. And I hope that nobody has any doubt about our ability to get steady operating expense leverage as we grow the company. We have a long track record of doing this and we have a long runway to continue to do it.
1,And I just wanted to know if you have a good sense of why these efforts that have been made more recently have some sustainability to it? And do you believe that the category in those markets is stable or is it just like what your business is doing is executing better? Thanks.
1,"And I mean that's the core incremental thing that happened during this year. Otherwise, it's a steady state business of incremental growth for our SMEs or large corporate or mid corporates and things like that. So that has been   or even the restructuring companies coming with a plan to refinance the debt and seeking additional rating for that."
1,"And I see you've been ramping up this expense over the past several years. Do you have in mind a steady state figure I guess or is that just depending on your free cash flow, how do we think about that?"
1,"And I speak for all of us here at NuStar when I say that while we, along with the rest of our unitholders, will feel the near term impact of this reset, the fact that we are unified in our endorsement of the plan we have announced, reflect our very real and vested long term interest in the future of this company. We believe, along with our board, the plans we've announced reflect our commitment to do what best positions to build long term unitholder value and stable, consistent growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom Shoaf, NuStar's Executive Vice President and CFO, to discuss our results and projections."
1,"And I think in regard to the margin, when you look over the next few quarters, just with the way everything is setting up, it looks good, we'll have a stable margin and maybe modestly positive; just again, if it sets up the way the balance sheet did here in the fourth quarter and with rates going up, I think that's a very positive thing for us."
1,"And I think I've said this before in some forums, I do think that in terms   we are looking primarily for opportunities within our footprint specifically in Minnesota and in Iowa. But I think the lower loan deposit, but good course stable deposit banks, even though they may not be good earners, if we have expense opportunities, we just think deposits are going to be very, very valuable to have. So, whereas we might not have been so interested three years ago, we might be a little more interested now just because of the benefit that comes from having stable funding that could be loaned out elsewhere in our footprint."
1,"And I think when looking back today, I think the effect of diminishing returns, we were probably in the beginning over estimating that, that's one point. I think that always in every market, there are diminishing returns and the moment where you keep your advertising stable, there is a wear-out effect of your commercials and so on. I think that is something that we will definitely address in the next year, where we want to have more commercials, invest more on creative development, and so on and so on."
1,"And I think you'll probably   I'm sure you'll recall, as we made a change in the first half of 2017 and put in a new leader in Japan, a new country leader in Japan, who has really reinvigorated that sales organization, and I think has really kind of tapped into the talent we had inside the company and also added some new people. And so we're seeing a nice steady growth in there and we're really pleased with our performance in Japan, and we hope to continue to build on that."
1,"And I would say, I think the exposure   our business' a exposure within that industry   we've got a fair amount of downstream exposure, which I think is going to have a   probably more of economic driver in terms of the build-out that happens there. And then our exposure to the other parts is more balanced than not, say, concentrating on fracking where there could be a sharp up and a sharp down, but more balance, and I think positions us for kind of long and steady growth in Oil & Gas, up against I think the likely new reality in terms of how the investment cycle plays out in that industry."
1,"And I'd say we've seen a very stable mix of customers' use of credit cards, other installment debt, other auto debt. And it's really been very stable in the last year in terms of how much debt our customer has, the number of line items, et cetera, particularly for the customers we approve and put on the book. So, my reference was much more to it was out there than it's competition."
1,"And if you see that this is related with the return of sale of about 10%, you see that for both for interest and taxes, there is a difference of 3 to 4 percentage points on that point. And the same thing we said we want to have our leverage ratio at a stable rate, so you can see that what is then the interest rates. So you can make then also some calculation of what's related to the revenue."
1,"And I'll just add, I think when you look, we're doing that, Stacy, so that our lead times can remain stable, and then probably coupled with that is we focus on making sure that we've got very high customer service metrics. So when we say we're going to ship something that we actually ship it on that date to customers."
1,"And importantly, our foresight regarding infrastructure investment and a focus on playing the long game, as it relates to responsible development, is something we believe will be an increasingly important advantage. Moving to slide 5, you can see that a significant driver in our continued EBITDA margin increases has been our stable production trajectory over the past two years, with an oil cut of just under 80%. Our average peer is producing just above 60% oil, which leaves us with a significant advantage from a blended commodity pricing perspective."
1,"And in 2017, we were able to improve the development significantly after some years with very negative development to achieve almost stability. And in 2018, we will then reach a very important milestone in our financial transformation as we are now expecting stable organic development, potentially even growth. Our financial performance has supported a growing DPS from 2016 to 2018."
1,"And in fact, if you look back, our net flows have improved by $6 billion through the nine-month period December 31 over the year ago period. And then finally, while quarter-over-quarter numbers can tend to be lumpy, we believe that our underlying metrics year-over-year highlight a steady improvement in the business and maybe a better way, even the best way, to evaluate our progress. So I look forward to updating you on our progress again next quarter."
1,"And in quarter three of this year, we have a lower base of last year. Having said that, we see steady improvement in economic condition and most of our product categories have performed well. So we clearly do see improvement in economic scenario."
1,"And in San Francisco, we're seeing a steady stream of activity and expect to continue to gain occupancy as we build the small vacancies, complete renewals and work on backfilling of the Bain space that comes back to us in early 2018. Overall, we are keeping our guidance for 2018 same-property NOI growth steady. It's a little ironic that the improvement in our fourth quarter 2017 run rate mutes the impact of the improvement in our 2018 leasing assumption."
1,"And in the second half of the year, we started seeing Medicaid-related volumes. So our Medicare volumes and our commercial volumes have been very stable through the course of 2017. So while there are urgent care centers in our market, we own and have built our own urgent care centers."
1,"And it just seems appropriate to do it at this moment in time. That doesn't mean at a future point we won't bring it back, but at the moment, we just said, let's not try to do anything to disrupt the steady   how steadily we treat our policy holders."
1,"And it should remain in the 13% to 16% range over the upcoming years. Our operating expenses for 2017, the sales and marketing remains stable at about 28% of our revenues and we dropped slightly our G&A. However, we continue to invest in our R&D, as we're investing in the Syncplicity product we purchased as well as the hybrid Integration platform."
1,"And it's been a fairly meaningful shift, alongside varying performances and where we came from with balance sheet, what makes you   where do you think we are in terms of that cycle? And are we now at a steady state where rather than being a net taker of market share, from here do you hold your own or are there more market share opportunities?"
1,"And just on the margin evolution guidance with the message of sort of margin pressure beginning to ease towards the end of the year. If your margin -contribution margin, as you've just described, stabilized in Q4 2017, and with lead times of sub a year overall and nine months in China, shouldn't that drive margin to be stable by Q4 2018 with potentially, as we talked about, savings? Or is there anything else in there that can sort of come into this equation that we're not seeing?"
1,"And just to give you an idea of the sample flow, so you understand what it is that we are doing here, from October 2016 through May of 2017, we were doing on average about 558 samples per month. And now a year later, after just four months of adult-use sales, we have seen a steady increase in sample flow. From June through September, we averaged about 900 samples per month."
1,"And keep in mind that these results were impacted by the tax changes and tax reform and so we think they represent particularly solid core net operating performance and we believe that that is sustainable in the future. We continue to benefit from an asset sensitive balance sheet and a very loyal and stable customer deposit base, had about a 4% impact on net interest income in 2017, and our NIM improved 19 basis points, again because of this asset sensitivity and importantly because of the strength of our very loyal and stable deposit base. Prudent expense management continues to be another important initiative and we were able to hold expenses relatively flat, they grew less than 1% and that was despite making investments in technology and other revenue generating opportunities, and so we think at this point expense management is clearly a hallmark of what we've been able to achieve."
1,"And knowing that we're starting the year with our largest customer, we're continuing very strong in ear and IoT. We have our hearing aid business being stable and our capacitor business looks pretty good. So this is the one area where I'm more cautious."
1,"and Latin America and visibility for fiscal 2019 have significantly improved. Moving on to our project pipeline, the number of opportunities remain stable at over $800 million, while the total value within our pipeline has grown to approximately $1. 1 billion."
1,"And now that we've got some scale, we can really start returning some of that profit to the bottom line. So we might not be driving right away to the profitability that some of our competitors have in the region, but I think we're trying to make sure that we go at the right pace to stay in line with the brand and make sure that we're working with the best partners out there, and we're going at a good, steady pace that's right for Under Armour and we'll continue doing that."
1,"And now this quarter, you grew 1%. So, is there some change in market share or some different products or is it like you reached a stable run rate with your current portfolio?"
1,"And now, when the board is proposing an unchanged dividend of â‚¬1. 1 per share for the calendar year 2017, our ambition is to pay a stable, sustainable and over the time increasing dividend now, and also in the future. And when we have been looking at the market conditions, the prevailing market conditions, we have decided to set ourselves a goal to avoid a temporary dividend cut."
1,"And on our margins, we are tracking at $35 on a last four quarter basis against what was a $39 a ton basis on a re-segmented basis because when we announced our targets, as you recall, we had not yet integrated Oregon and CSS. So, we are ahead of 2019 and that is one of the reasons why we have looked at retained capacity and assuming that the market remains stable or continues this positive trajectory, we anticipate being able, on a similar growth rate, to hit our retained capacity of 5 million tons and to further expand from the 2019 margin targets at least another 15%. And you may recall that the 5 million ton volume target, we reached as recently as fiscal year 2011."
1,"And one of the things I'm trying to do with the commercial and the operational team is make sure that, that becomes exceptional service. And you can see from our comment earlier on that the revenue line is stabilizing and stable. And I look forward to being here in due course, saying we're enjoying the full growth as the market leader in a big growth market."
1,"And our expectation, of course, March 2018 is relatively stable wherever we are or maybe a little bit upside. But next year, we are definitely expecting 25 to 30 basis point improvement."
1,"And our full year operating leverage, excluding acquisitions, was 27%. We are well on track to reach our long-term goal of approaching 15% operating margin when the housing market returns to steady state levels. Turning now to capital deployment."
1,"And our other three markets today Atlanta, Tampa and Phoenix have all been kind of right around 5%. As we look forward to this coming year, we do continue to see the opportunity to push rental rates and that's really driven by we continue to see good solid steady demand, and as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, very little speculative construction."
1,"And over time, we're going to continue to drive that towards 80% through the mixed upgrade, through the portfolio management, like getting rid of the excess ethylene and continue to drive and focus on the portfolio side of this equation. In addition, our goal is to turn fibers back into a specialty business stabilizing toe, and you see a lot of ways in how we're growing outside of toe into the new other market applications, return that into a modest growth business with very stable very attractive margins and cash flows. And that would become part of the story in one day too once we prove it to you."
1,"And related to that, would you expect to get the subset analysis, particularly the greater than 100 milligrams per deciliter patient population in the label? Secondly, related to that, would you expect the same cutoff and frankly discounting policy to apply to the stable CHD population, which of course you had in the label and presumably are still continuing to treat? And then just lastly, to follow up on the last question, are you aiming for the $100,000 per QALY thresholds or the $150,000 per QALY thresholds with the plans that are compliant?"
1,"And ROIC is a primary focus of everything we do across that strategy. So, from an investor perspective, we have a history of stable and profitable growth and the identifiable nature of our sources of growth comes across all four of the platforms and in Filtration in particular, new product development, supplemented by acquisitions certainly expands our product offering across the aircraft and naval platforms we have. Within our Utility group, everyone's aware that the grid and the aging infrastructure is a tremendous disadvantage to us as consumers, but it's a tremendous advantage to us as suppliers into the maintenance programs of those utilities."
1,"And services also impacted still from the grounding impact of the Super Puma, but the guys over there, as Tom said already before, did a fantastic job to compensate that by cost savings. Our Defence and Space performance overall was pretty stable before the perimeter change. Well, not all of the improvements at Commercial Aircraft came through as a part of that; I mean, got eaten up by our investments in continued innovation."
1,"And so to me, stability is the key. We've had a good stable R-over-P ratio here for the last many years, and continue to add our reserves primarily through organic activity. I talked about the reserve adds this year being driven by the Permian and Gorgon."
1,"And so we're not going to be calling out exactly what our strategy is on pricing for the next period of time, but rest assured that our sensitivity to fuel is well embedded in our pricing strategy. And while we would hope for a stable fuel price, of course, we haven't seen that over the last few weeks and so we know what we need to do for the rest of the year going forward."
1,"And so we're very focused on making the investments we need to sort of regain some of that share in some of those particular products. Having said that, there are parts of the corporate trust business where our market share has been stable or growing over that time period as well. So this is really a focused effort on particular product sets in that business."
1,"And so, again, more of that on the subscription line and less new maintenance, as well as the flips or the conversions that we have. And those continue at a steady but pretty strong pace of the number of customers each quarter that are currently on-premises paying maintenance that moved to our subscription model and moved to the subscription line typically at 2x what they were paying in maintenance, but it does have a negative effect on the maintenance line. So, those two things together are really what have slowed the maintenance growth."
1,"And so, as we've gone through the last couple of years, we've seen some price declines. As I mentioned in my comments, our pricing from Q3 to Q4 was stable and we're seeing some price lift as we move here to 2018. So, I don't think the   when we look at it at the product line level, prices were pretty stable Q3 to Q4."
1,"And so, that has enabled spreads to stay much more stable than they typically would this long into a recovery cycle where you typically have kind of a race to tighter spread. I think spreads here has stayed very stable from our perspective in the category of commercial real estate lending that is our sweet spot."
1,"And so, the pace of supply, although it has continued to grow slightly on the supply growth side, it has grown gradually. And so, that fits in well with what we've seen in our pipeline from the standpoint that we are meaningfully taking share of the rooms that are getting added, but we have been able to see steady growth. There's the financing environment has continued to stay attractive and you're continuing to see economic growth, because GDP seems to be, albeit, not terribly strong, it continues to look steady and the power of the brands and the power of loyalty programs continue to draw new owners to our 30 brands."
1,"And so, this is a decline from the initial forecast of 40%. However, because the factor of the increase of the profit is not based upon cash, but it is based upon the accounting financial settlement and because of stable reimbursement to the shareholders is our basic philosophy and due to these factors, we have decided to make no changes to the dividend. That concludes my remarks about the third quarter results."
1,"And so, we're always working to expand the margins. And particularly on our stable mix, that's a big focus for us. So margins are very good."
1,"And so, we're getting some additional pricing power, but not much. But I don't think our margins, as Mike indicated, reflect a pretty steady state situation."
1,"And so, we're sort of assuming and thinking about the financial profile of our company going forward, but this is sort of going to be a return profile lower than sort of the group 15% target. But by the time I think about the way we deal with our reinsurance on CTP, when I think about the way we're delivering on sort of customer's needs as CTP is part of a package of a product, when we sort of get there as a -- making a contribution to IAG, but we're definitely seeing it as a more stable, less   the trade here is we're taking up volatility. So, we've got more stable earnings profile is my expectations, but we've definitely, on average, going to be stepping down our return because of the changes in the scheme."
1,"And Sprint, relative to late last year, has increased slightly. Looking at the last three or four weeks, a slight improvement by Sprint in maybe 2 or 3 basis points, but very, very stable there. So, we're very comfortable with what we're seeing from a flow standpoint with all the typical promotional noise and the competitive front that's out there."
1,"And thank you for joining us today for our half yearly financial summary. Over the last few years, as you know, we've spent an enormous amount of time and effort in calibrating our balance sheet so that we can provide investors with a stable and growing distribution, which we believe should underpin investor expectations. The results in this half confirm that strategy and illustrates it, I think, very well."
1,"And that brings me to the guidance which targets again a dividend of CHF 22. If we will meet the guidance, then of course we will keep this stable dividend. The overall guidance is revenue at around CHF 11."
1,"And that gives you an indication of whether they are concerned about constraints or they're trying to take too much inventory and we look at that. We also look at inventory in the channel, which obviously we control to some extent, but our lead times are within normal range and we're not experiencing any supply constraints and our lead times have been pretty much stable the entire year. Maybe they went up by a little less than a week over that time."
1,"And that is really just paced by the pace; two of them, one was customer quals, which are now largely behind us. And then the second one is just ramping of our internal capacities, which is a very steady rate based on our investment profile."
1,"And that set us back at the start of 2017. That was a sort of swamping of the boat that came through at one point in time for a few months, and then what you saw was more of a reversion of the trend line, which is, Yelp making steady progress, improving our account retention. So that issue feels at this point like it's pretty far behind us."
1,"And that's before the impact of obviously the improved corporate tax climate, which we'll enjoy in 2018. And importantly, in the fourth quarter asset quality remained stable, our non-performers were down and our coverage of non-performers remains well above 200%. From a strategic standpoint, I think 2017 was a transformative year."
1,"And that's mainly the result of those higher costs, as mentioned, and a weaker quarter for the Financial Markets business. On the back of fourth quarter growth in core lending of nearly â‚¬7 billion as well as relatively stable margins, the NII excluding Financial Markets was actually up 3% in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter last year. So basically you see that the underlying development, not only the commercial development but also the underlying income development in NII and commissions ,is really strong."
1,"And the coverage is spread across the country. And whatever transformation journey that we are taking in terms of digitizing, mobile banking, Internet banking and Fintech, all these will lead to steady improvement in our operating performance as we go ahead. The overall workforce number stands at 55,725."
1,"And the other bars are the cash that we've paid out for acquisitions going forward while maintaining the red line, maintaining our cash balances over a period of time. Moving on, we consider our balance sheets very stable. We're a well-capitalized R&D company, software company, still with good liquidity."
1,"And the second relates to January provisions resulting from the growth in the individuals portfolio in the quarter in Brazil. On page 13, we show our total allowance by type of risk remaining quite stable at a level of BRL 36. 7 billion."
1,"And the team that we have built up or set in place now for ship agency in Singapore is actually really, really encouraging to see, is built up by people who really know the business and who is highly motivated, and I'm very, say, confident that we will see the results of this going into future years. And also, then, if we go into Ship Management, this has been a very stable part of our business. We have made decision to relocate head office for Ship Management as well to Singapore."
1,"And then any impact that mix might be having that on a longer-term basis on margin. I'm thinking about maybe your move more into entry level or maybe as you look to gain some market share in some of your newer markets, are those becoming a bit more of a drag on your gross margin that we should be aware of, or should we just think more broadly about the stable trends you've been reporting over the last couple of years?"
1,"And then as I commented earlier that why is revenue is not growing as fast as the maintenance base, because a significant part of revenues come from the first service period. And that is, of course, more now stable, because of stable new equipment deliveries. But, yes, we did accelerate towards the end of the year."
1,"And then as the year goes on, we'll continue to add capabilities to that facility that will allow us to further repatriate volume as we go forward. But as you think about Q1, I do think you will see that dynamic in our underlying results on margin, although as Craig pointed out, we do expect a more steady delivery of EPS to kind of counter. So, as you're thinking about that phasing, hopefully that's helpful."
1,"And then finally regarding loan losses and the levels   and everything we can see in our books is that the credit quality remains to be very strong. If you look at the payment behavior of our customers, if you look at non-performing loan levels and so on, it is very stable. In these two cases   and I think the Carillion, it's really a very special case   I mean, it was a well-known company with a strong reputation and a really solid company, and they have been a customer of ours for many years."
1,"And then more specifically on CapEx. There we have kept that stable now for four years, and what we see there is that this will also be pretty stable for 2018 as well. So, there we don't see the same kind of little bit uptick as we see on the R&D side."
1,"And then, as we move through the rest of the year, the story becomes consistent with the full-year picture. The one item I would say in Q3, we do have a $20 million compounding settlement in our 2017 results, so we'll probably talk about that, but beyond that I think it's fairly steady progress."
1,"And then, their obsolescence should be somewhat more neutral over the mid to long term. And then we felt actually very good about the fact that our net product margins were very stable in the quarter. And so the underlying kind of product health of the business felt good to us."
1,"And then, wondering if you could touch quickly on sort of the trajectory for NIM in 2018? Understand there's a bunch of moving pieces sort of with and without rates, but just generally speaking, is it your expectation that core NIM can stay relatively stable with a hike or two this year?"
1,"And there was not any particular place of   nothing that we're worried about there. On the pipelines, I would say our business is very steady on the pipeline front. I'll say what I've said on these calls for the last probably three or four quarters."
1,"And they've always viewed us as a core partner in everything that they do. This just creates another opportunity for us to go to clients and essentially reiterate our value-add that we are the steady ship that   when as you grow your business, we want to grow with you at the end of the day. What Blackstone ends up doing with Thomson Reuters is a question to see going forward."
1,"And this also while containing erosion on some more legacy products like voice and some legacy data, where I think also for the first time we give you here, quite some transparency of the portion of our fixed data solutions that are still what we call the legacy but you see that it's now only 13% of our total revenue. So we have been able to manage that quite well, I think over the last year, the service through for voice, where there is of course a steady decline, but the decline is also well controlled by the EBU colleagues. That all ends up into an underlying EBITDA growth on the domestic perimeter of 2%, and this includes heavy net roaming impact of â‚¬41 million."
1,"And this year, we're a little more level loaded on revenue throughout the year which is driving a lot of the improvement. So that's a tailwind but from a headwind perspective, as I mentioned earlier, we're going to see a drop off or we expect to drop off from the midstream, particularly, the valve product line year-over-year, even though it's steady in the second half of 2017 and that's our assumption in 2018, we had an incremental $30 million to $40 million of shipments at very good stated margin from those pent-up projects that we were awarded in Q1 2017. So, there's kind of couple of line items going two different directions for us."
1,"And typically, they're performing at somewhere between a quarter and a half the profit potential. So, all of those factors come into play when we're looking at buying and how we operate and then obviously, 12 months later, they start to roll into our same store sales numbers, which helps to keep that number pretty stable."
1,"And we are laser-focused on how we can optimize revenues. So the plan is steady and our occupancy is relatively high for the markets. But as you know, we see opportunities."
1,"And we are on track to deliver another $95 million to $110 million of pre-tax run rate benefit by the end of 2018. On page 22 you can see the steady and impressive progress we are making in improving our performance. Since 3Q 2013, our ROTCE has improved from 4."
1,"And we believe it's the right thing longer term even though it's clearly cooling down the markets right now. And if you look at both of these trends what we see in our market, we see that our market has been more or less stable. And when we go into 2018, we expect a similar-ish trend to continue that we expect in 2018 market to decline slightly will be stable, but the key drivers is what I talked about first."
1,"And we believe we have a solid performance in the quarter considering the very high pulp prices that we have had in the quarter and that the price compensation will take place now this spring, and even so the net income of SEK 121 million is the highest that we have ever recorded in a single quarter. Looking more into the business areas, in Table Top we had relatively stable quarter with some impact on lower sales in certain markets and of course Table Top is the business area, the segment, which is most impacted by the high input of the raw material prices. So the SEK 121 million is definitely a solid performance for Table Top."
1,"And we ended the year on a very positive note. We had a strong fourth quarter driven by good global volume growth, increased pricing including our second consecutive quarter of positive pricing in the Americas and stable fleet cost. Our emphasis on driving manpower and shuttling efficiencies continue to yield positive results and our commitment to cost management was also effective in the quarter, with our adjusted EBITDA margin improving year-over-year."
1,"And we have opportunities to further high grade the portfolio, cycling cash back into the most attractive opportunities. Moving to the sustainability of our resource base, the chart on the left shows our reserves to production ratio is both sufficient and stable. It's not too high, too low or too volatile."
1,"And we remain well-positioned in the market with strong relationships with the leading public and private cloud providers which should continue to drive incremental interconnection opportunities at the Reston campus. Finally, in New York/New Jersey, demand is steady and slowly increasing, specifically among financial and healthcare sectors, which is reflected in our solid enterprise leasing results. We continue to see cloud and network providers expand in NY2, while large local enterprises continue to move towards leveraging hybrid cloud use cases."
1,"And we think that we'll be successful through time to provide access to these patients who need these drugs. And I think a good case study of what I'm talking about is if you look at our Prolia product, which is now in its seventh or eighth year, growing at 20% annually over the last several years, similarly started with a very gradual uptake curve, and has been very steady and continuous over the years. And we think that that could be a good analog for what we're facing in these cases, which is really supporting the value proposition of the product and educating the market in a number of cases which is true here to a biologic drug and the change of clinical practice associated with that."
1,"And we view residential mortgage credit as being good, and obviously that's in the numbers. But can you characterize a little bit kind of your process around credit and what you're seeing out there in different MSAs meaning, are you seeing different areas that are frothy at all, that you're downgrading, or is it generally stable, are there more weak areas now than a year ago? Just trying to get some color on kind of how you see the overall credit environment, and if you're having more downgrades and upgrades in the way you look at the MSAs in your book?"
1,"And we want to push it down to the mid-40% level in the mid to long-term. And for the credit cost, as aforementioned before, we are going to improve our portfolio quality, so it's going to be at a very stable level of 20 to 25 bps. For loan growth, to elaborate, there has been many government policies and the Bank loan growth, we are looking at about overall 5% growth, in household 3%, and corporate 7%."
1,"And we'll see also significant exploration and appraisal work in PNG focused primarily on gas to define some of our future resource options and priorities for investment in further LNG expansion and optimization. And of course, we'll continue to work with governments and all stakeholders in PNG to ensure ongoing stable operating environment and that you can't ever, ever be complacent about that. We worked extremely hard and will continue to do so."
1,"And we've focused a lot obviously on making sure business is more stable, moving from manufacturing to R&D in a lot of segments, increasing our software content, which is more of an annuity, just as Services is, and increasing our Services business, and all of those things, coupled with a variable cost structure that we have in OpEx by going to outside contractors, has given us much more bottom line protection during downturn. So, that's an important aspect of the investment profile."
1,"And we've got a lot of confidence in our commercial execution. And also, our product lines and our position in the market, we think we're in a much more stable portion of the market today where we have better ability to manage margin."
1,"And we've seen that and we continue to see that here. Having said that, there's also minimum requirements for brands that are an important part of our stable that we make sure that we don't slavishly just chase where the best ROIs are, but we're also prudent and we give solid brands enough support so that we don't have a tail that we have to address down the road. So there's a lot of science to it, but there's still some art to it."
1,"And what you want is you want that mid-teens type growth to flow right through to the bottom line. For that to happen, you need to have your credit quality effectively stable compared to prior year. And most of, I think, the big banks that are out there are guiding to late 2018, early 2019 before things flatten out."
1,"And when you do that, certain customers will think a little bit ahead and add a week or so of inventory in this particular product to hit that sort of space. To your specific question on the migraine product, we do understand the competitor rate is also coming back on market there as well, and we're expecting to be fairly stable again back to the original trends before they had some disruption."
1,"And where we've been seeing more of the stress again has been especially in the higher risk part of prime. So our portfolio in custom, which is $600 million to $660 million, has actually remained pretty stable as well as our A through C grades. It's really been D through G grades, where we've seen the issue."
1,"And while we expect that there will be some sort of a movement, right, from more of a regulatory spend to more of growth-oriented spend. But we're quite comfortable with the position that Pravin had shown that for our calendar year 2018 perspective, we see spend as being stable for the sector. In certain sectors or in certain subsectors, like in regional bank solutions, we've seen the fact that clients are having to do a lot of catch-up, so they're investing significantly more in terms of their digital or their mobile strategy."
1,"And while we've always had it, I will tell you that the intensity of focus on innovation at our company is at an all-time high. And while we haven't seen that yet play out in our numbers, what we have seen is we started to see a number of steady drumbeat of launches. We launched a number of products in 2017."
1,"and with improved cost absorption as the new investments delivered growth. Specifically on NF3 margins, stable pricing and lower NF3 costs from our investment in hometown will return overall PM margins to our target levels. If NF3 pricing strengthens in the back half of the year, we will see some upside."
1,"And with our strong backlog and expectations that demand will stay strong for the rest of this year, our objective is to increase production quarter-over-quarter in 2018 as we did in 2017. And with steady improvements in our pricing power, we should see gross margins steadily expand as well as expecting significant advances in our operating profits and earnings per share. I think it'll be good for us to remind everyone that the last time our company was in the $250 million in sales range, we had gross margins in the 19% area and EBITDA of approximately 9%."
1,"And with the addition of this to the infrastructure, we certainly hope to be able to service more of our sponsor customers and be able to expand on the back of this infrastructure expansion. Besides of course BA/BE study for generic pharma companies, we are also making a very steady progress and making great progress with introducing regulatory and PV services and these are to our existing generic pharmaceutical customers. Just to kind of give a little bit of context to this, many of the generic pharma companies now certainly are required by global regulators to abide by post-marketed safety, capturing of cases, enabling work flows and reporting, so on and so forth."
1,"And yeah   and the only other comment with respect to your question about number of patients affected, we can't speculate on what will happen out in the post-marketing setting, but to say that we would expect a small minority of patients to be impacted in this way. And I say that based on our extensive clinical trial experience, and if you remember our Phase 3 trial showed that supported approval of Ocaliva showed that virtually all patients experienced improvement   some improvement in these lab parameters or remain stable, whereas patients who are only receiving UDCA standard of care, approximately a third of them actually increased over the course of the study. So, obviously, we'll keep watching for this."
1,"And you mentioned reaching positive operating cash flow in 2020. Presumably by that time your working capital will kind of be, maybe more of a steady state and those CapEx investments might have been made. So, how do we think about the revenue assumption when you talk about positive operating cash flow in 2020?"
1,"And you've heard us say many times, our free cash flow generation is incredibly high. When you just look at steady-state EBITDA and I'd say we don't even grow our free cash flow generation off our EBITDA is roughly 50% to 60% when you think that, on a run rate basis, we're paying only $40 million in interest expense. Maintenance CapEx is roughly 4% of revenue."
1,"And, as you know, Japan tends to move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter based on how the different categories are doing and fiscal years, and so forth. But, our Japanese business has been, in the broader picture, quite stable and a good cash flow generator."
1,"And, finally, we have been able to optimize our marketing mix. If you think about it, our take-up rate, as you can see, has been stable for the last two years. And what we shared with you, we said when economic times are better, we are able to go and renegotiate some of the contract and increase our take-up rate."
1,"And, importantly, these new leases were signed at average rents that were 37% above the leases that expired during the period. And despite negative sentiment regarding bricks-and-mortar retail throughout much of the year, occupancy in our core retail operations remained steady at 96% due to over 9 million square feet of leases that were completed during the year. Same-property NOI increased by 2."
1,"And, of course, that goes to further mitigate the risk on those contracts. But all of this, coupled with the trading, means the group has a stable platform, and we remain on course for our double-digit growth in profit this year and to achieve our Vision 2020 targets. I'll now hand over to Bev just to cover the financial position."
1,"And, yeah, we're consumer-centric, we're flexible and we're agile. We have a momentum as evidenced by our earnings and our share growth and we've built an industry position of increasingly branded products and strong customer relationships, and I'd argue that both of those are very powerful platforms for ongoing stable earnings growth. And we've taken a purposeful approach to M&A, focusing on brands, capabilities, scale, synergy, new geographies or markets and we've demonstrated that we know how to pull businesses into our organization both big and small while delivering the kind of returns that shareholders should expect."
1,"Annual metal spread also improved as average sales price increased more than our average scrap costs. For our metals recycling platform, ferrous metal spread stayed steady in the fourth quarter despite lower average quarterly scrap pricing. Conversely, non-ferrous shipments and metal spread improved resulting in fourth quarter 2017 operating income of $22 million."
1,"Any thoughts on that? And secondly, just for modeling purpose again, if I look at your amortization of this realized gains reserve, should we keep it at stable at 2017 level, which is around â‚¬320 million? Or do you reckon that it could go up or down?"
1,"Appreciate the color. Second question, your loan   excuse me, your deposits to earning assets have been very stable in the 90% to 91% range. Should we think about funding this year with a consistent deposit base, and maybe can you guys give us an update on how you see the deposit beta kind of as we stretch through the year?"
1,"Approximately 39% of the remaining non-core assets are two oil names which have improved in value significantly and have been hedged to reduce the volatility of their potential outcomes and approximately 27% are in shipping assets. Further, we continue to make steady progress to improve the overall risk profile of our portfolio by increasing our exposure to first lien and floating rate loans and decreasing our average borrower exposure. At the end of December, first lien debt had increased to 50% of the total portfolio."
1,"Aranesp declined by about 7% on a year-over-year basis with lower unit demand, favorable prior-year adjustments, and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. With EPOGEN, the underlying business remained relatively stable with the primary driver being lower net selling price as a result of our extended Supply Agreement with DaVita until 2022. Over the last couple of years, we have grown our U."
1,"Are you still targeting to make those kinds of acquisition given the guidance you gave on your solvency? On your dividend policy for 2018 and 2019, in term of payout ratio, my feeling is that it implies kind of stable dividend of â‚¬0. 20 per share of those two next year."
1,"As a consequence of recent changes in demand the handling of six oil , we now expect IMTT's contribution to our 2018 results to be down. We expect the decrease will be partially offset by the continued stable performance of the rest of IMTT our other businesses and by the full year impact of investments made during the past few years. We are reducing our forecast 2018 dividend to $1 per share per quarter."
1,"As a reminder, we generally forecast minimal tax benefits from equity-based compensation in our tax rate. This benefit was the primary driver of the steady improvement in our tax rate throughout 2016 and 2017, but we have not reflected a similar level of benefit in 2018 as any impact will be driven by future option exercises, so we'll update our tax rate as they occur. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $27 million versus $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2016."
1,"As a result, today, we're achieving double-digit growth rent growth on new and renewal leases. Similar to the Boston's Seaport building, the Cedars Sinai medical office buildings are very valuable and stable assets that make up a sizable portion of our medical office portfolio. These properties are the foundation of our medical office portfolio, but as I pointed out they are clearly not our only valuable assets."
1,"As a result, today, we're initiating 2018 guidance consistent with our previous disclosures, and we are affirming our Utility, Parent & Other longer-term outlook through 2020. Beyond that, we continue to see a good path for steady, predictable growth at our core business, as we continue to modernize our infrastructure. We are laying the foundation now to be the sustainable solutions-oriented utility of the future that provides customer-focused innovation in a changing world."
1,"As Alex shared with you earlier, our Solvency II ratio has increased 6 percentage points to 201% during the fourth quarter. The increase was the result of our own funds remaining stable despite the impact of U. S."
1,"As always, we aim to grow our market share by providing an unparalleled customer experience in stores and now online. Since May, we have made tremendous progress with our eCommerce platform and have experienced steady growth in website traffic with solid performance across all key metrics. We see the demand for additional online offerings."
1,"As Brad mentioned, we're seeing right now limited pressure on deposit rates other than in the treasury management area with public funds and larger corporate deposits, there certainly has been a movement up there as well. But when you tack on the potential for two or three more increases in 2018, certainly we'd expect to start to see some upward movement in retail deposit rates, but overall from a modeling perspective, we would still expect to see our margin pretty stable to maybe slightly higher, and that would be from two sources, one would be the continued remix of a greater amount of loans and a bit less in investment securities. And then as Brad had mentioned on an overall basis, we still remain slightly interest rate sensitive."
1,"As far as the initiatives, they are advancements of the ones that we've been executing against. And our econometric model keeps us steady in the background of the advancing, and specifically you ask the highlights of those initiatives, and one is the fact that we've moved our digital media buying in-house which gives us a lot of nimbleness to be able to make adjustments very quickly, especially with things like search terms. And then, we've been quite effective in advancing our referral and repeat with our loyal customer base, and then again having that econometrics model in the background."
1,"As for our service provider business, it's been pretty consistent story over the past year. Our current customers are between major upgrade cycles globally, so we continue to get steady orders. Moreover, this past quarter, we added several smaller orders that were generated by our news inside sales team."
1,"As Gaye mentioned, private wealth management sweep accounts represented 6% of total assets at year end. Sweep accounts represent a strong stable source of consumer deposits for the bank. In addition, these deposits are highly diversified with an average account size of only $116,000."
1,"As I mentioned, it's about $450 million run rate in that part of the business. And when you look at it in terms of, kind of carve it up and look at the different areas of content if you will, our flagship market cap indexes or DM or EM market cap indexes have been delivering about a 9% growth rate over the last several years and it's been very steady and we continue to be excited about the ability to sustain that. And then when you look at some of the other areas of content being some of the areas that are growing faster, Factors and ESG, we're seeing increasing demand from clients for Factor based strategies, whether it's minimum volatility or momentum or low carbon indexes, we continue to see really strong demand there."
1,"As I mentioned, our total cost of interest-bearing liabilities remained at 55 basis points. Our average balances of Fed funds purchase and repurchase agreements dropped 36% compared to the third quarter and the favorable variance related to the mix of total liabilities more than offset the increased cost of interest-bearing deposits serving to hold the total cost steady. Our total funding base is about 23% hard indexed to short term interest rates."
1,"As many of you know, Vectren has a long history of high investment-grade credit ratings and we will strive to continue that. To that end, we expect to issue a balanced mix of debt and equity, as needed, in an effort to maintain our strong ratings, where currently, we have an S&P rating of A- at the corporate level, and a Moody's rating of A2 at the utility level, both with stable outlooks. Turning to slide 17 in tax reform, as Carl mentioned earlier, we expect the Nonutility Group to benefit by approximately $0."
1,"As Nish pointed out, we were accretive in the first quarter of owning that asset. And we continue to see a nice steady recovery in our gas detection business. Gustavo Lopez will be talking a little bit about the technologies and how we go to market and win in those markets in a little bit, and we continue to see further growth and rebound in our head protection."
1,"As of December 31, our portfolio of companies continued to generate solid growth in their aggregate earnings. The weighted average EBITDA of our corporate portfolio companies were $62 million and the leverage levels and interest coverage levels remain stable for both the quarter and the year at 5. 4 times and 2."
1,"As Pat mentioned, in 2018 we will benefit from lower corporate statutory income tax rates, which will benefit our earnings performance. From a lending perspective, our asset quality profile continues to be stable and our prospects for a continued consistent loan growth, our primary net interest income driver, are reflected in a robust loan pipeline. To further discuss our positive lending results for 2017 and prospects for 2018 is Peter Cahill, our Senior Lending Officer."
1,"As we discussed last quarter, the exceptional full-year revenue growth and margin increase in Detection & Measurement in 2017 was in part due to the low starting point of some of the more project-based businesses within the segment, which operated closer to cyclical troughs in 2016. We look at 2018 as the segment getting back to a more normalized level of performance with a steady demand environment, and we would expect future growth to be more in line with our long-term expectations of 2% to 6%. In Engineered Solutions, revenues for the quarter were generally flat with the prior year, the decrease in revenues associated with our business model shift in process cooling, largely offset by higher sales of transformers."
1,"As we enter 2018, we have access to more than $1. 5 billion of liquidity with a capital structure that remains well aligned with our investment grade credit ratings, all of which have stable outlooks. Moreover, our leverage ratio is projected to improve modestly during the course of 2018, with further deleveraging towards our target ratio over the next several years achieved through growth in EBITDA and using excess free cash flow to reduce debt."
1,"As we extract the swap fee income, however, you can see that there is much more stability in the margin than might appear without being able to see that information. So, we're showing you this now because we believe that you'll see that our margin really has done fairly well and has been quite stable. During the quarter, we obviously increased 6 basis points, which we were very happy about."
1,"As we go into 2018, we don't have the need to do that. So, the prices we're bringing back to our customers are going to be very stable from what they've seen before. So, you can never predict in our space, but I think our competitors out there today, many of them have seen difficult pricing cycles."
1,"As we have continued to expand our business, we have achieved strong increases in the group's operating net profit after tax. Importantly, this is underpinned our continued steady delivery and an increased distributions to our investors. Predictable, growing distributions are a major focus for Centuria."
1,"As we're investing more in data and technology, we continue to change the composition of our employee base and you're actually seeing comp-to-revenue come down. So while we will continue to focus on managing the entire expense base as we stated, we would expect 2018 G&A to creep up a little bit, but we would also expect comp-to-revenue to decline and we don't think any of that will basically impact the   in stable markets the upward bias in our overall margin."
1,"As we've mentioned at the interims in November, the second half of last year did see a benefit from FX, which we do not expect to be repeated this year. However, despite this, we remain confident in our ability to maintain stable gross margins in the full year. On cost, by the end of this financial year, we have completed the first phase of our Performance Improvement Plan and delivered Â£30 million of cumulative annualized cost savings."
1,"As we've stated in the past, it is our goal to have our core earnings meet or exceed our regular dividend payout. Finally, investment performance throughout the year has been good, non-accruals have been stable and we just completed our eighth consecutive year of net realized gains on the portfolio. As you've heard from us in the past, we emphasized full cycle total returns from our diverse sources of revenue and we're happy with how our overall business is performing."
1,"As you can see from the slide, dollarization level of loans decreased by 6% year-on-year and was 60% at December 31, 2017. At the end of December, our liquidity position stood strong with regulatory liquidity coverage ratio at 113% and net stable funding ratio at 124%, while our net loan-to-deposit ratio and IFI funding stood at 92%. As you already know, NBG has introduced new capital adequacy requirements based on Basel III guidelines."
1,"As you can see from this chart, for the last several years, we've been getting 7 points to 8 points of growth out of a combination of product upgrades and price. That more than offsets our very low rate of attrition, which has been holding steady at about 4. 5%."
1,"As you can see in the bottom right, this is our adjusted EBITDA growth that grew 10%, so slightly faster than net sales. With the exception of 2010, you can see that our adjusted EBITDA margin has been relatively stable over time, initially in the mid-7s, over the past couple of years we've been more in the high-7% to 8% range, I think one of the things that's important to understand about the model is, we do have a highly variable cost structure. Our SG&A does tend to vary with our gross profit."
1,"As you can see, this guidance highlights that we expect the adjusted EBITDA of our retail business to grow substantially. Finally, we expect our 2018 core investments, that's to say total investment excluding cable related investments to remain stable compared to 2017. Then on slide 34, I also wanted to share with you that the board of directors has decided to propose the Annual General Meeting of shareholders to distribute an ordinary gross dividend for the financial year 2017 of â‚¬0."
1,"As you know, 2017 was a very challenging and special year for Nexa. From the floods and fatalities we faced in Peru at the beginning of the year, the change in production procedures in Pasco complex, the execution of the IPO and a robust fourth quarter performance, we can say we are entering 2018 prepared to move on with a much stable operation, being able to cope with a very favorable market condition for base metals. As I said, the fourth quarter performance was much more robust than the third quarter and in line with fourth quarter of 2016."
1,"As you know, we saw in the early stages of Phase 1 trial where we had a several drug holidays that occurred, which indicated preliminarily to us that less frequent dosing may be available to patients in a maintenance dosing mode. The use of the IV infusion during the clinical trial held during the measurement of the primary endpoint, which is again the ORR4, a stable reduction in the mSWAT score for at least four months will be employed in the Phase 2 study. However, our intent would be in an open-label extension to them explore both less frequent dosing as well as alternative routes of administration such as subcutaneous and bolus IV administration, build the amount of data that would support alternative routes of administration and less frequent dosing eventually in clinical practice for the compound."
1,"At a high level revenues in North America, Australia, and the UK/Europe were consistent with our outlook with any variances related to the mix of business and/or operating costs. In North America, other than weather-dependent commodities such as coal and agricultural products, our Q4 carloads were stable and coal rates were up approximately 3. 5%."
1,"At the end of the fourth quarter, Binck employed 579 FTEs and the sale of Able decreased the employee base with 74 employees. Adjusted depreciation and amortization expenses were stable in the fourth quarter at â‚¬1. 5 million to â‚¬1."
1,"Athene's asset management capability is a key competitive advantage. Our investment philosophy takes advantage of our low-cost and stable liabilities, which enable us to underwrite complexity and liquidity risk in addition to credit risk, and help us achieve 2% to 3% investment margin with significant downside protection. Our high-quality investment portfolio performed very well during the year, and the yield on our floating rate securities, which are 29% of our portfolio as of January 1, is materially increasing with the large increases in LIBOR rates."
1,"Australia's important for us as a focal point for many different reasons. First, the political and regulatory environment is stable compared with many of our global markets that we operate in. Second, much of our germplasm across the three crops I mentioned were, in fact, specifically developed for the Australian market, and thus, performed very well given the characteristics of the geography."
1,"Aveo's annual Resident Satisfaction Survey was undertaken last October and we've gained new and important insights out of it. As an aside, our resident satisfaction rates were stable on last year, but with the noise, the willingness of residents to recommend Aveo has fallen. Following a period of consultation with staff and our communities, we've created improvement plans to address any specific community concerns."
1,Backlog conversion was solid. Our core margins throughout the business have been very stable and really our outlook going forward is continuing very stable on a core margin basis. We did see lower impact from litigation and warranty this quarter.
1,"banking industry. A highly differentiated level of client satisfaction produces a more stable client base, and allows us to do more with our existing clients. It also leads to strong word-of-mouth referrals."
1,"Bankrate. com has been a great source of funding for us and very, very stable, the attrition rates have been very low since 2012, and we're not seeing that pick up as rates have risen here for the last year or so. In fact, our money market deposits today fund our loans at LIBOR less, call it, 15 basis points."
1,"BBA's backlog continued to be healthy at $14 billion. Our stable delivery outlook in the short term and better production rate flexibility ensure we can capture incremental demand rapidly. Revenues at Business Aircraft reached $5 billion during the period, in line with guidance."
1,"Beyond   as client goes out as a portion of the hard disk drive market and the data center part of the business expands, what we call near line, you will see that volatility start to go away too. And what you'll end up with then in our enterprise storage business is an extremely stable business, single-digit growth, if at all, but extremely profitable."
1,"Bob, as I've kind of said over the course of the past couple of quarters, I think it's mainly focus. And so, by having these roughly 20 now dedicated coronary reps, I think we'll get much more consistent and stable growth in our coronary business. And by then feathering in these really well-trained clinical specialists in our high volume accounts, we'll be well-positioned to take advantage of the opportunity that's there."
1,"Both of these businesses are now in the market, are integrating with our banking platform and are beginning to show some modest growth. So overall, another strong year with steady progress executing our financial and strategic plan. Turning to slide number 6, let's cover results against our key financial targets for 2017."
1,"broadening the scope of our innovation model with breakthrough global platforms such as a light-based pain therapy device; continuing steady growth in AVEENO Baby; rapidly expanding e-commerce and scaling Perfect Store; building our portfolio through insight-led innovation that delivers superior science and differentiated products that are professionally endorsed; and relaunching the Baby franchise with new formulations in new packaging to meet the purchasing preferences of millennial parents. I am confident about the strategies that our Consumer business is putting in place, but I also recognize that to drive value and lead in the market, we will have to stay focused, continue to evolve our capabilities, and deliver solutions that drive growth."
1,"But across the portfolio, when you look at the growth rates, our growth is very broad and I think you can see where the areas that there are some places that it does feel hot, that could moderate as we get in the second half. When we look at our channel partners, our channel partners' inventory have been staying pretty stable and their sell-out and our sell-in, their point of sale and our point of purchase is pretty much in line. So it's been nice to see that that inventory in the channel is not going up."
1,"But again I think we believe that we have a very strong capital base. We like our risk position, we like our businesses, we've almost transformed our business mix to a much more stable and reliable source of revenues, we don't seem to get the benefit of that in the test. So, there are some things that we would like to sort of see play out a little bit further, but we feel like, we're in a very good position."
1,"But all that we would   I've spoken a lot about the VNB margin and the way we are looking at it. So, what we are saying is that, if we continue to grow our business even with the kind of product mix that we are having currently, this would show a steady improvement up to a point and say, we have 14. 2% became 15."
1,"But and/or not, but I should rather say and that's because we always would recommend not too much focus on single year's growth rates because they may be influenced by such effects. But by and large I think what we can see and it's very much backed I believe also by our 2020 outlook, and I think what we are predicting now here for 2018 is very much in line with our 2020 guidance, that way, that is out there for many years now already, shows that we are rather on a very stable underlying growth path, and we would consider 2018 to be pretty much a representation for such underlying growth rate also whereas 2017 was below the average probably and 2015 and 2016 clearly were above the average. So, I cannot exclude that we will see some fluctuations around this average going forward."
1,"But as you say, it is early days but things are continuing to head in the right direction. So relative to the grade, we saw in November-December, we've seen an uptick of about 20% in that grade through the first part of this year, which is quite consistent with our expectations of a steady and marked increase over time in the grade. The mill is running very well."
1,"But at year-end, we are debt-free. And we also see that we have a very stable equity ratio of a little bit over 40%, and that is well met if you compare to our long-term goal low of over 25%. So to summarize, we have managed to grow and invest with our internal resources."
1,But could you give us some color on sort of how long you think it will take to ramp up a 13-million-tonne-a-year plant if commissioning starts in late 2020? Is it a fairly quick ramp-up in your view or you're giving yourselves 18 to 24 months to get that to steady state?
1,"But equally for Perpetual, we've evolved over that time. If you look in the last decade in all the equities which is I think where the asset class, your question comes from, the majority of our new strategies have been concentrated equity strategies that are relevant, that are high obtained alpha-producing strategies, together with our core and stable long-term performance of Australian share funds and in the industrial share fund and concentrated equities as well. So, those two things are all about relevance, about staying close to clients, and I think Perpetual spends a very deliberate amount of time knowing our current clients, protecting the core of our business, which is what Lead & Grow has been all about and growing into extensions, but turn to those extensions beyond those equities."
1,"But even otherwise, larger deal wins in digital, more profitability on digital deals, et cetera, all of which will also contribute to improvement in profitability. Finally, as our two acquired entities Bluefin and Magnet start becoming breakeven, more stable growth, et cetera, so that's also a margin lever. Thirdly, the operational efficiency improvements, cost reduction progress, et cetera that we have, there is a continuous amount of focus on those as well, so that's also a margin lever."
1,"But for those investors looking to take some control over their finances, no matter how large or small the role they want to play, we are the place for them. Our third area of focus is our Corporate Services business, in which we aim to continue to build our large stable of corporate clients and our overall participant base and further enhance our offering for both sets of customers. With the leading technology platform in Equity Edge Online, along with superior service and a number one ranking in customer satisfaction and loyalty, our Corporate Services channel is already well positioned to win RFP battles, and the value proposition is only getting better."
1,"But I do think that in design and in business model evolution, et cetera, there were good opportunities. And now that we've got a business much more stable and now we're allowed to have those conversations, I think the next year or two will see us upping our game in that regard."
1,"But I think for next year probably all the way up to 2020, I think we will start to see that this bottom line trend will certainly revert. So, I think to answer your question shortly that we are going to maintain this very stable dividend payout policy. That's first thing."
1,"But I think, looking back at the development we've had during 2017, I think it's fair to   I mean, that is what you can have in mind when you look at the future. Our growth, we have seen no major changes in the demand for new loans, and so it's a quite stable picture. We have no reason to believe that it should change dramatically."
1,"But if we can have the opportunity to offset inflation with price, and normally this business generates like a 40% contribution margin which is really high. And so that, as long as the business is steadily growing, call it, mid-single digits, we have the opportunity to get accretion in our margins with steady growth while still investing in the business for things like technology and try to accelerate those like what we did last year. Even with the incremental investments, we were still able to grow the margin across the globe, and so that's the business model, if you will."
1,"But if we turn to print, I'm kind of wondering in sub-segments such as books, which seems that curve, that decline curve seems to be flattening out. If you could give us some color maybe on some of the major categories that you've outlined on slide number 7, maybe the top four retail inserts, magazines, catalogs and direct mail how we might expect some type of organic decline or is that just going to flatten out and maybe with Ivie we might even see some topline that would be steady to maybe even up?"
1,"But in general, because if we look at the onsite pricing and offshore, both were up about 5% on average from last quarter. So, are we expecting some reversion back to previous realized rate per hour or is this something which will remain stable going forward?"
1,"But in general, the flow of problematic credit at least in our books seems to be much under control. As you would go through our numbers, while our bank has had a pretty steady growth in this quarter, despite more challenging bond markets and everything else, we have seen a significant growth coming into our subsidiaries, particularly the four areas which have had a   which are having an excellent time in the marketplace, namely the securities business, the investment banking business, the asset management and our life insurance business. And if you sort of dissect our numbers which my colleague, Jaimin, will also take you through, if you take out our banking and NBFC businesses and look at these four businesses broadly, the actual growth rate in profits Y-o-Y is nearly 80% on those numbers."
1,"But internally, we have done some   our risk analysis and in May, we will disclose to you the threshold or the range at which we are at ease with the current regime. But I will repeat myself in saying that when you look at the visibility of this   of the earning in this company and the fact that core earning has always been close to the reported earning, we feel that the best source of capital is profit and that we are able to deliver steady profit. And that's the main reason why I've always been at ease with the range of 175% to 200%."
1,"But of course it takes time because the new operators must get some licenses. We are of course operating in offshore and very sensitive areas, so it will not show up in as early as 2018, and that is the reason why we foresee stable activity in Brazil. Staying in Brazil by the way about the forest, your   what we commented   what Olivier commented is that, we now have clearly an excess of forest capacity compared to our needs, and now that we have restructured or we are close to completing the restructuring of our steel making activities in Brazil, so we need significantly less charcoal than the capacity of our forests."
1,"But of course, if you assume now, we wouldn't raise any more equity or any other product but only debt which comes at the lower margin, just mathematically, this would have an impact on the overall revenue margin. But you may assume going forward, as all our business asset   our asset classes, they grow, that the blended rate will be rather stable and our pricing has not materially changed over the years."
1,"But once you're in it in the broad market, it stays there for a long time, which is why we're not forecasting handset volumes because when we do that you have a tendency of not having the stability of the base that we want. So we're going to create a stable base that we can run off of   run our OpEx off of, and when we hit those handset wins, they'll just come in and we'll tell you guys they're margin hits for us but they're cash positive for us. So we'll go ahead and take that cash pay down the debt, but we don't want to forecast those."
1,"But our basic thesis of growth 20%, 25% for us, I think that remains intact, because that is not really based   that is not really based on India becoming 10% cheaper than we world. All the needs, India has to remain competitive, our regulatory environment has to remain predictable and stable, and I'm convinced of the power and the momentum being generated in the Indian economy for the next four, five years."
1,"But over the next few quarters, as the mix kind of normalizes and cost of NAND comes down and SSD solutions' margins improve, we should see kind of gradual progression towards that 50% target and the normalized 30% gross margins that we've seen in the past. Our model consists   continues to be kind of the 50%/30% model, 50% gross margins, 30% target on the operating margins, and the way we look at increasing operating margins is a very consistent, steady growth of responsible operating expense growth relative to what revenue growth is."
1,"But overall, it looks like even their brands saw, for the first time in a long time, a stabilization of share. So, just at a high level, installed base and has the shakeout sort of stabilized there, right, like are we sort of in a steady-state market share for all the brands in your opinion? And then I'll just pass it on."
1,"But primarily looking at that multi-family segment, I guess, what were the yields on originated production in the fourth quarter there? And as you look at future loan growth, if it's going to be coming from the multi-family segment and commercial real estate, where the flatter yield curve is really impacting those spreads, and you're putting on wholesale and cost for your funding to support that, is there any thought of maybe slow loan growth in this type of rate environment until the funding base is more stable or is the loan growth kind of an outcome of the production let alone the funding?"
1,"But relative to our share on the folding carton side   and Alex tracks this pretty carefully   against all the industry statistics, we do not see fundamental shifts out of paperboard and into plastic or vice versa. So we see that as kind of a steady march and that's reflected in our overall volume guidance that we just gave you. In regards to kind of pre-buying when OCC is lower, that'd be primarily on the open market paperboard side."
1,"But RevPAR in AccorInvest was up 3%. Revenue was stable mainly due to changes in scope of consolidation particularly with the disposal of part of the F1 hotels portfolio and of course major renovations on a number of our bigger hotels, including SwissÃ´tel Singapore, a particularly large hotel, and the work we're doing refurbishing Sofitel in Rio. These had a negative impact on EBITDA and EBIT."
1,"But so far, it's not something to report that we're going to change the environment. Our existing capability is very stable, as you can see from our performance but that's something that we're taking seriously and looking at it and testing."
1,But that also could be one that turning on the take rate could have very attractive margin characteristics. So I guess what I'd say to answer your question is that we think we can make steady consistent margin progress. The core business has that 40%/50% incremental margin characteristic to it.
1,"But that will evolve in much the same way mobile has evolved, and we want to ensure that Pandora is positioned to benefit from continued proliferation of these devices. Speaking of monetization gains, one of our highest priority initiatives is enabling programmatic sales, and as Roger noted, we continue to make steady progress on that front. We are excited about the potential of our programmatic efforts to enhance sell through and optimize pricing by tapping into new demand without having to rely on low priced performance based ad channels as the company did in early 2017."
1,"But that'll continue to go on in the background. And we always assume when we get out our projections, that there's a steady flow of that BD spending going on into the future. What happens on the M&A front is we do from time-to-time see windows where a number of assets pop-up where we see a really good opportunity, and that goes back to Abraxis and ABRAXANE."
1,"But the reality is those were trough levels, right, so about 12 hours from the last dose. So, we believe that higher dosing and more steady dosing during 24-hour period would be beneficial. SAGE-217 is really not amenable to high doses in the morning."
1,"But we believe we were best positioned to absorb the impact, deliver growth and expand access. In fact, it was precisely because we saw where the industry was heading that we embarked about a decade ago on our journey to transform Mylan and move into the much larger and more stable global community we now live. As a result, we're able to leverage the benefits of scale, diversification and integration, giving us deep confidence that Mylan truly is Built to Last, as demonstrated by our performance this year."
1,"But we do believe that the mix of products and the steps that we've taken on the cost side position us well for further expansion in profitability. And then, cash flow for all the obvious reasons for a company our size with some of the investment needs that we have to grow the company, as well as some of the obligations that we have on the pension side, has been a focus for us for the last couple of years, and we've made steady progress, we believe, on that dimension as well. We did, as you saw when we reported last year, begin to make some pretty decent, I would say, solid progress on managing our pension obligations as well."
1,"But we want to offer   and again   I want that in the future. Our OP unit has currency, is going to be very important when we equilibrate, when we kind of get to a more, let's call it, stable share price that recognizes the hard work Mark and Lisa and Paul and Josh, and Kim and everybody else has done, but it's a non-starter."
1,"But when we look at our own data, when we look at our own sense, we haven't seen anything which we would call out as normal or outside of normal, so it'll be very difficult for us to say if we've really seen it. Our numbers across categories, channels show that there is a steady stabilization or normalization of trade and pick up in the consumer demand."
1,"But you're right that onsites, the gross margin reduction should come one-on-one out of the SG&A, because onsite has a better delivery model. If we look at our operating leverage this year, we held the margin about stable, while we're making 25 basis points of investments. So we are driving operating leverage while we have the 30 basis points headwind into the gross margin."
1,"But, net-net, it's a big drop. And even notwithstanding percentage of completion accounting, I don't see how it's stable, unless you have in your business planning a new order. So, if you could comment on that or if I've just got it wrong, which I may have."
1,"By focusing on the Triple Aim, we believe we are well-positioned to succeed in this era of healthcare reform and to differentiate ourselves. At Hanger, we believe that the investments we have made in our claims documentation improvement initiative and the revenue cycle management functions, combined with our ongoing implementation of our EHR system, have positioned us well to effectively realize steady revenue and cash flow. We expect that our stable base of revenue in our Patient Care segment, combined with an effective supply chain, clinician productivity and the optimization of our locations will serve to establish an efficient and scalable business model that will enable us to foster profitable same clinic growth."
1,"By increasing the sample size, we believe we were able to further increase the likelihood of success of a robust and convincing result across a number of different endpoints in our pivotal study and that we can deliver a stronger dataset on the secondary endpoints that we know will be under focus by the FDA. We have continued to make steady progress in enrollment and we expect to complete our revised enrollment target by the third quarter of 2018. Top line results are therefore anticipated to be available in the second quarter of 2019."
1,"By March 31 of this year, meaning end of this fiscal year, we aim to add another 23 branches, so that we get to a 150 branches before the end of this fiscal year. Our BC branch network is more or less stable at about 360 branches. We are not expanding that for the time being, that is really our assets lending machine in the lower customer segment."
1,"By retaining a greater proportion of the cash we generate with our operations, we believe we will have the financial strength and flexibility to compete for good projects and grow. We're confident that even given the headwinds we've described and the market challenges in the MLP sector, through executing on our plan to simplify our structure and reset our distribution for healthy coverage, NS will be well positioned to produce steady growth and value for our unitholders as we have in the past and for many, many years to come. With that, we'll open up the call to Q&A."
1,"Cai, as we said in the past, I mean somewhere between $400 million, $500 million is plenty of cash given our working capital needs and our investment requirements, and the way we transact our activity, and we have that, and we've stayed steady at those kinds of numbers and we certainly have that on our balance sheet. We've also said in the past that absent any sort of M&A requirement, we see getting back into a peer group level of 2 times leverage is an acceptable leverage."
1,"Can you say something about total market size for the whole business of Q-Free? Is it growing or is it stable and how is your market share, how is that developing? Are you growing faster than the market or are you at the same growth level or how is it going?"
1,"capital market. Our operation in Singapore continues to see strong, steady growth and we expect to see similar trends in Hong Kong over time. Scottrade's domestically focused Asian business provides an additional synergy here as we combined our legacy operation with our growing Asian footprint."
1,"cash tax payer in fiscal 2018, due to the availability of tax loss carry forwards and the 100% allowance on certain capital deduction allowance on certain capital expenditures. Consistent with our assumptions, we expect our end markets will remain healthy and stable and continue to support the realization of our outlook. We'll now open the call for your questions."
1,"Certain coal-fired combined heat and power facilities are system relevant assets and can be cost effectively converted to biomass-fired generation. In the UK, the government affirmed an additional Renewable Obligation Certificate or ROC and have sent it for Drax which Drax said will allow it to convert a fourth unit to biomass from coal by the end of the year, expecting to drive increase and more stable demand for wood pellets across its power plant. In the Netherlands, â‚¬6 billion were made available to renewable energy projects during the spring 2018 round of the renewable incentive program called the SDE-plus."
1,"Certain deal activity was pushed into 2018, and much of this decline was offset by strength in client-driven commercial real estate income, particularly structured real estate, where pipelines have been building nicely throughout the year and were realized in the fourth quarter. All in all, revenues were stable sequentially and up 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. On an adjusted basis, we showed continuous improvement in our efficiency, with an adjusted tangible efficiency ratio at 59."
1,"Certainly more than offset on the subscription line, but it's a combination of more of the new business coming in the cloud and so again more of the subscription line and less new maintenance as well as the flips are the conversions that we have. And those continue at a steady but pretty strong pace of the number of customers each quarter that are currently on-premises, paying maintenance that have moved to our subscription model and moved to our subscription line. Typically, at 2x what, they were paying in maintenance but it does have a negative effect on the maintenance line."
1,"Certainly, we expect to continue to see some cost increases, but our ability to either offset that through other categories or to offset that with some modest price increases we believe is still there. So just, overall, market tone just feels very stable, very steady, and our outlook for margin is solid for the year."
1,"Chile, 53,000 tonnes versus 45,000 tonnes last year, so some growth in Chile. Other units, which is the Faroes and Ireland for our part, stable at 16,000 tonnes. So, no changes in our full year guidance."
1,"Chris is targeting a 25% cost reduction that will be important in terms of our business, focused on both safety and productivity. Our processing operation is arguably the most efficient in the industry, delivering a stable 9% margin, we need to continue to improve, to make sure we stay there. But for us, we think we're very well-positioned in the industry, right to the left, protect your margins, and the long-term prognosis is pretty good when you think about the new technologies in fuel cell and hydrogen that it can   that could impact us in a very positive way."
1,"Clearly, as these charts demonstrate, over the past year, we have built a very solid track record in paying dividends. Our ambition is to pay a stable growing dividend. The strong increase in operating results drives the higher proposed dividend for 2017, maintaining at a payout ratio of 45%, and this leads to the already mentioned â‚¬229."
1,"Clearly, we're looking to create a business that has sustainable performance. We at Informa have talked, often I think, that our ambition is to be a steady, progressive, sustainable growth business delivering cash and margin returns. We've recognized the importance of predictable robust underlying growth and you have both businesses on a good to growing growth track."
1,"Collateral management income increased 18% due to higher yields; and our Derivatives business, second largest business that we have, contributed 41% to our total revenues. Market Data and Connectivity, our steady business, accounted for 12% of total revenues and continue to show steady growth, registering a 4% increase year on year in revenues to SGD 24 million. Next, we look at the expenses."
1,Commercial had a good year. I would say it's a very steady build out of our team there. I think they're getting their sales motion down.
1,"competition. And here, the 11% fourth quarter growth was entirely driven by Aubagio, whereas Lemtrada was stable. Before I move on from Specialty Care, I would like to say a few words about the global rollout of Dupixent."
1,"completing the integration of LifeWatch; expanding our comprehensive approach with a full market release of a series of patch products, both MCT and extended-wear Holter; continuing to grow our Research services backlog at the accelerated rate we're now experiencing and converting that backlog into revenue; building out our digital population health management business; and expanding on key partnerships we have developed. Given our excellent results, the momentum of our business, the stable reimbursement environment and greater visibility into the synergies created by the acquisition, the company has never been in a stronger position. All in all, things are tracking better than anticipated."
1,"Connectivity backlog MRR has trended higher in the second half of 2017, reflecting the success of our cross-selling and bundling initiatives. We believe these metrics point a stabilization in the rate of connectivity revenue decline over the next 12 months, driven by gradual improvement in our backlog MRR, in conjunction with lower churn and stable ARPU. Moving on to ARPU, we have seen average price for both business segments remain relatively stable, although for different underlying reasons."
1,"Consequently, we've reviewed our long-term financial ambition in order to achieve a sustainable target that clearly reflects two objectives, our wish to maintain a top tier position amongst peers and the ability to accommodate changes in the operating environment, whether positive or negative. The new relative financial target where our long-term ambition is to rank in the top 3 amongst major Nordic peers in terms of return on shareholders' equity is therefore truly aligned with our ambition to be a stable, balanced and predictable bank. Slide 11, please, and over to Thomas."
1,"Considering all this, we expect a 5% growth in our cement volumes during 2018. In Germany, our cement volumes increased by 15% during the full year with stable pricing. Volume performance reflects solid consumption from our main demand sector as well as our participation in major infrastructure projects."
1,"Consistent with our prior years, I'm going to use my time on today's call to review the market conditions that we expect to encounter in Camden's markets during 2018. I'll address the markets in the order of best to worst by assigning a letter grade to each one, as well as our view on whether we believe the market is likely to be improving, stable or declining in the year ahead. Following the market overview I'll provide additional details on our fourth quarter operations and our 2018 same property guidance."
1,"Consolidated revenues for the year were $16. 2 billion, in line with our guidance and stable year over year. Underlying this performance is a 24% revenue acceleration in the Transportation segment in the second half of the year."
1,"Consumer confidence on a healthy level, still I must say that the consumer market, the renovation market is not growing fast. It's high, it's stable, it's a good market, but there are of course, some uncertainties when it comes to all the measures that the authorities might take when it comes to consumer lending and amortizations. Disturbances have been handled."
1,"Consumer lending also did well in the fourth quarter with our core retained portfolio growing in excess of 4% for the period. Asset quality remained stable during the fourth quarter, with the percentage of non-performing loans to net loans and percentage of delinquent loans to net loans improving during the quarter. Charge-offs for the quarter of $568,000 represents over an 11% improvement, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, and full year charge-offs were approximately 10 basis points."
1,"Continuation also in the development of our optical strategy and here our brand Safilo is meant to play a key role this year. On our license portfolio, we are today assuming a stable business both for Dior and Marc Jacobs. While the other core licenses Jimmy Choo, kate spade, BOSS, Max Mara and so on, we think we are well-positioned to recover some speed across the different consumer segments where each of our brands play."
1,"Core deposits. Our ongoing objective is to maintain a low cost, stable source of funding for our loans and securities. Interest income."
1,"CORE EBIT was approximately CHF 960 million, with CORE EBIT margin close to 19% and CORE RONOA for the combined company was 29%. The charts on slide 9 give evidence for steady and continued improvement across all of our key metrics. Now, let me elaborate briefly on the CORE RONOA chart on the bottom left."
1,"Could you maybe give that to us again? And then, similarly on the housing front, is there some numerical indication maybe your average rates versus the market that helps explain the small mass affluent bias that you have because, you know, just looking at the overall growth picture on volumes, it's hard to square your main peers saying that they'll see revenue stable this year. You're saying you'll see revenue stable this year, but they're growing at almost double digits and you're growing at 2%?"
1,"Credit losses were in line with our expectations, our portfolio yield stabilized and loan receivables grew by almost $500 million in the quarter. We also further strengthened our balance sheet, reduced our adjustable (sic) [adjusted] tangible leverage and issued debt at a meaningfully lower cost of funds. All-in, our Consumer and Insurance segment generated $1."
1,"Currency fluctuations had only a minor impact. Strong volume growth and stable pricing in our premium and non-premium implant solutions lifted the gross profit margin, but were offset by increased labor and ramp-up costs in the expanded facilities. The combination of these factors reduced the gross margin by 90 basis points."
1,"Dave, this is Bob. Certainly, as we've talked about in the past, we look to be a high return bank, and we know that our steady performance leads us to that. We are still a CCAR filer so we still have to work within the constraints of that for a top-tier holding company."
1,"development areas I have referenced this morning, which we anticipate can deliver a three-year 10% to 14% compounded growth rate for oil. We expect stable conventional oil production from the Gulf of Mexico and our international assets and significant high-return oil growth to our Delaware and DJ. With the exception of the Delaware, all of APC's other assets generate material free cash flow at $50, and we expect the Delaware to achieve the same success within a couple of years as we finalize the infrastructure build-out and takeaway capacity to handle the pad development volumes."
1,"DEWALT was the only provider with growth across corded products, as well as low and high voltage cordless products concurrently. Our stable of brands continue to perform well on a global basis. With Stanley, Black & Decker, Mac Tools all up single digits, while Proto, Vidmar and DEWALT all expanded double-digits."
1,"Discretionary free cash flow is expected at mid-single digits CAGR between July 2017 and June 2020. Our CapEx plans and our commitment to our investment grade and de-leveraging objectives are reiterated also, as is our undertaking to serve stable to progressive dividend. Nevertheless, for the current year, we expect to have a below average CapEx spend."
1,Dividend is a very important way to provide returns to our shareholders. We believe stable and continuous dividend is the best for the shareholders who own our shares for a long period. We have set dividend policy at stable dividends at payout ratio of around 40% for three years up to 2018 under the five year mid-term business plan.
1,"Domestic drug were a negative Â¥4 billion, and details are shown on the right. Among the domestic products, the revenue of REGPARA declined which was more than offset by the steady increase in revenue of the new products, including G-Lasta, NOURIAST, Onglyza and others, leading to an increase in revenue in total. Regarding the overseas drug, we saw a continuous improvement in revenue from the Abstral and the Asian products."
1,"Dorothy has been a pleasure to work with and was particularly important as we integrated the Ocean City Home franchise in 2016 and 2017. Operating results were generally in line with our expectations with strong loan growth, decreasing core operating expenses and stable deposits. Our progress against important benchmarks including core ROA of 1."
1,"During our call in December, we indicated October and November sales were up high-single digits. In December, we saw continued momentum, exceeding our expectations as daily shipment volume remained steady through the end of the December holiday period. Actual reported sales for the quarter were up 11%, consisting of organic sales growth of 10%, and favorable foreign exchange contributing another percentage point."
1,"During the half year, the group has increased its co-investment portfolio to AUD 277 million, which represents an 83% increase since June 30 2017. The group's co-investments provide an additional stable recurring source of revenue, contributing AUD 9. 2 million in operating revenue for the half year, and further diversifying the group's income sources."
1,"During the half year, we extended the average maturity of our bilateral debt facilities by canceling AUD 190 million of facilities expiring in 2018 and replacing them with AUD 125 million of facilities expiring in 2022. As a result, our weighted average cost of debt has remained steady at 3. 8%."
1,"During the half, in November 2017, Aurizon Network repriced and extended an existing AUD 525 million bank facility with maturity extended to 2023 and tranche size reduced slightly to AUD 500 million. As you can see, Aurizon retains minimal refinancing risk, and our credit rating with S&P and Moody's remains at BBB+ with stable outlook for both group and Network. In August, I talked about capital structure and what we deemed to be an appropriate target gearing for the group, taking into account the ability to meet credit metrics, market conditions, and in particular, the uncertainty of the UT5 Decision."
1,"e. , that negative effect that our EBITDA minus CapEx is going to be stable to slightly improved this year, with the exception of layering the bonus payment that didn't occur last year and that will occur this year. Stable to slightly improved."
1,"Early integration efforts also contributed to higher revenues and profits as we were able to deliver additional new units that otherwise would not have been possible due to labor and capacity constraints. Additionally, our land-based businesses experienced a steady backlog for the remanufacturing of pressure pumping units and transmission overhauls. During the fourth quarter, the number of units on premises for remanufacturing remained elevated at levels compared to the third quarter, though it did decline in December as we approached the holidays and customers' inventories of cold-stacked equipment started to decline."
1,"EMEA was up 5% in terms of sales, driven by also the market, which was up 3% for passenger car in EU and 6% for LCV. Our inventories were stable at 71 days, in line with the prior-year number. Our shipments were up 5% to 1."
1,"End customer demand based on customer point of sales data has stabilized, but our replenishment orders continue to lag POS. Demand for our McCall sewing patterns products have been stable over the past four quarters since we acquired the business. We also have been pleased with the performance of the Simplicity business in our first three months of ownership."
1,"Entering 2018, opening backlog is up across all three segments and we expect 75% to 80% of backlog to convert to revenue this year. Looking at our 2018 full year targets by segment, our revenue target reflects the higher beginning backlog position to start the year and assumes run rate orders in total stay steady to the second half in 2017. As Marc mentioned, we did not factor any new orders greater than $15 million into our 2018 guidance."
1,"Essentially, if you talk to our team, they'll tell you that at 2017 the last quarter of rate changes, pretty much meant that 2017 was a wash. So we sort of have a stable year versus 2016 and this is what's behind our commentary about the market. So, it's holding slightly improving and clearly, there has been   there is an improvement in that level, there is also an improvement in ROEs and return in margins."
1,"Even if some new entrants in China are currently ramping up their production, we are confident that our competitive advantage will stay intact since it takes decades to achieve the high levels of differentiation and quality we are able to offer. In Coatings, Adhesives and Specialties, we kept our core volume stable year-on-year in a difficult year. We started the year with a strong core volume growth including some pre-buying in Q1, then had to cope with volume phasing in Q2."
1,"Even when we were doing higher, we guided around the same levels. So we believe our business steady state is good at 20%. If you look at the last five, six, seven years that we are in this business, so we have been around this margin, barring this couple of years when the margins really shot up."
1,"Fair enough. And just when that project layers into your spending, assuming it's a large hundreds of millions of dollars commitment on your behalf and that you funded at the Boardwalk level, how does that spending   how do you envision it relating to your   once Coastal Bend is in place and you think your EBITDA would be growing or stable   to layer in additional spending may interfere with your ability to reduce debt to the point where you're comfortable raising the distribution. What are some of your thoughts around those trade-offs?"
1,"Finally, our engine repair and overhaul business has completed its three-year restructuring work and is in the strongest shape for many years. And so, now that the business is healthy and the marketing conditions are stable, our board believes it's the right time to conduct the strategic revenue of the business to evaluate our options. So, let me get down to the unit level."
1,"Finally, we continue work to expand our click and collect footprint that allows customers to pick up their groceries from our stores after ordering online. With respect to our Wholesale customers, we're seeing steady growth with their adoption of our SV digital platform for their website and mobile app needs. SUPERVALU provides this service to both our Corporate stores and our Wholesale customer base, helping shoppers adapt to the rapidly changing landscape of digital and e-commerce across the grocery industry."
1,"Finland is new for us. And at this point, a different type of business, and as much as it is focused really on our outsourcing, advisory and property management, which is by its nature very stable, the opportunity there is to build out onto that, as Jay indicated, on the transaction side, and we think it's a healthy economy. I'd say that, that whole Nordic region is healthy."
1,Finland is slightly improving. It's a stable market with a little encouraging outlook. Europe   we'll go to Europe.
1,"First question just on the tax rate and going to 27% and some of what we've seen over the course of earnings season is a little bit bigger moves from others and so, maybe just some of the puts and takes and whether we should think about 27% as being more of a stable rate over time, or whether you're looking at things that will also potentially bring that down?"
1,"First, one of the luxuries, I suppose, of the diversity of the growth opportunities we have is that our constraint as a company on the levels of customer-facing growth investing we do each year is really not that we run out of opportunities with very attractive long-term economics, but more that we do manage the company for a mixture of short, medium, and longer-term objectives. We believe it's really important as a company and for our shareholders to show steady earnings growth every year. And so when you look at the opportunities we have to invest for growth, generally, in any given year, there are a variety of unfunded initiatives with good economics that we choose not to pursue because doing so, in the short run, would not allow us to meet our financial objectives."
1,"First, the hurricanes and wildfires in the back half of the year; and second, and more significant in my view, declining margins generally as interest rates remained at historically low levels and loss trend has outpaced rate and exposure for a few years now. As we've been doing all year and as I reiterated last quarter, we'll continue to seek rate thoughtfully and in close coordination with our agent and broker partners with the belief that our customers are well served by a stable and predictable market that keeps pace with inflation as opposed to more dramatic price swings of the past. Given our sense of the market and the fact that retentions remain at historic highs, we're encouraged."
1,"First, the simplification of our tax reporting that the elimination of K-1s should enable us to appeal to our broader shareholder universe and in turn, we believe enhance our liquidity and trading volume. Next, we have adopted a dividend policy designed to support the value creation for our shareholders through both growth and income by pegging our after-tax dividend to our stable growing level of core earnings, driven by our management fees, and through retaining earnings for potential share repurchases and further investments in growth. Last, our shares after the change should provide us with a more liquid and attractive currency to use for strategic transactions to further long-term growth and value creation."
1,"First, we believe that spending from our largest Tier 1 service provider customer has reached a bottom that should be stable to mildly improved next year; Second, most of the product integration challenges are behind us; Third, we expect better traction from our new products, especially those that can be sold into new areas of IT and security. Additionally, we believe that our ability to deliver software-centric solutions will help us further fortify our incumbency with key service providers, move us down market to support a broader range of enterprise customers and to support further gross margin improvements."
1,"First, we'll follow a calendar quarter end and classify our quarters into four three-month quarters. And we'll also fine-tune our same-store sales growth calculation by using a stable base of stores for the whole year, as opposed to a rolling base of stores which changes month-to-month. There's no significant change to our historical same-store sales growth numbers."
1,"-focused Candlewood Suites brand since we acquired it in 2004, demonstrating the power of IHG Systems and our ability to plug in new brands and drive their growth. 2017 marked our best year for opening for Staybridge Suites since 2009, and our international expansion for this brand is making steady progress. We now have 11 hotels open across our EMEAA region and a further 14 hotels in the pipeline, including our first in Southeast Asia, which will open in Thailand in 2019."
1,"Following that Kalpit will you give you an update of our operational and financial results for the period under review. In nine-month FY 2018, we have reported growth of 10% revenue growth, net of excise duties on strong growth from our international business and stable domestic performance. This is encouraging given the volatile operating environment in the past few quarters."
1,"For 2018, I would characterize it that it's going to be relatively flat, primarily driven by the fact that we're still finishing integration. We would expect over the course of time, in all of our segments as we get through this that we would see a trend toward better margins across the entire system as a result of completing the integration and moving the company into optimization, but stable for the year."
1,"For 2018, we are looking at our subscriber growth, as we have stated in our remarks and for growth, subscriber growth for both Acorn TV and UMC. And that subscriber growth as we see it, is going to come both from organic growth on existing platforms and existing marketing initiatives, a key metric that we have talked about in the past is our cost per subscriber, which has remained remarkably stable over the last few years. What that is allowing us is to increase our marketing expenditures year-on-year and continue to increase our acquisition funnel without hurting our margins."
1,"For 2018, we expect that alternatives on our Retirement Services segment will return approximately 10% for the year and, of course, those returns will vary, likely, quarter-by-quarter. We expect our cost of crediting to remain relatively stable and we will continue to target a 2% to 3% investment margin on deferred annuities in 2018. Consolidated general and administrative expenses as a percentage of average invested assets are expected to decrease as we experience efficiencies from our operating platform, as well as the mid-year closing of the Voya transaction, although liability costs within Retirement Services in 2018 are expected to be higher than in 2017 which benefited by 15 basis points to 20 basis points from equity markets, outperforming our expectations."
1,"For 2018, we'll be focused on profitable growth and cash generation. The favorable environment with stable regulatory framework will continue to support outsourcing of services. Revenue growth should come from Multisector clients focused on higher value-added solutions and our digital platform."
1,"For 2018, we're expecting free cash flow, defined as the change in debt, net of cash, to be between $35 million and $45 million. With the exception of our net revenue and tax guidance, our financial guidance for 2018 assumes that currency rates, primarily the Swedish krona and the euro, remain reasonably stable at current rates and relative to each other. We expect adjusted income from continuing operations to be between $2."
1,"For 2018, you should expect gross margins around this level or better. We discussed a number of the puts and takes at the Analyst Day and I'd like to emphasize that gross margins are stable and under our control. As we've described since the IPO, we remain focused on doing the right things to grow the business long-term rather than maximizing gross margins in the near-term."
1,"For all these reasons, we have worked diligently in 2017 to move this towards a global launch. Throughout the year, our development team made steady progress on the kit, culminating in our CE Mark study. This multisite study demonstrated the strong performance of the device."
1,"For example, in 2017, we accelerated our efforts to minimize PepsiCo's environmental impact, enabling us to streamline costs and mitigate our operational impact in the communities we serve. We have teamed up with disruptive startups, leading universities, governments and innovators to develop biodegradable film resins that meet the sustainable, flexible packaging requirements of our global food and beverage business, a technology to help advance our goal of designing 100% of our packaging to be recyclable, compostable or biodegradable by 2025. Despite the many challenges we faced over the years, from changing consumer preferences to disruption in the retail environment, to geopolitical turmoil, we have consistently and substantially reinvested savings back into the business to further build capabilities and adopt technologies that we believe will enable us to sustain our top line growth."
1,"For financial services, we had a very strong quarter and full year 2017. For the fourth quarter, the portfolio book value grew by 29% following record-high PD investments, whereas ROI was relatively stable at around 15% or 16% excluding revaluation. We saw continued growth per our three-year strategy as we outlined in the December Capital Markets Day for investments in SME and secured portfolios where such asset classes now account for about 15% of total portfolio book value as opposed to 12% (sic) [about 13%] at the end of Q3."
1,"For instance, I think we are asking them to do also to do loans in Quebec now, they will do a little bit more loans in Quebec because we are very cognizant. We do want to keep our proportion of exposure   real estate exposure to Quebec stable compared to the rest of the country, we feel that in a down cycle scenario being overweight Quebec is going to be a very positive factor for us and we want to maintain that. So, we have flexibility around the Paradigm Quest, I think it's going well."
1,"For market share as we continue to scale up the business that will bring economist scale and further reduce our unit operating costs. For profitability, our key principle is we're going to gain market share while maintaining stable profitability of our business. And he also says that doing an express delivery business, it's like running a marathon, it's a long journey, and service quality is key to ensure stickiness of our customers and loyalty of our customers."
1,"For more than a century, the strength of 3M business model has enabled us to invest in the business while also returning cash to our shareholders. This has included a strong, steady and rising dividend, which is the hallmark of our enterprise. Over the last five years, we have doubled 3M's per share dividend, and today, we're announcing a 16% increase in our first quarter dividend for 2018 to $1."
1,"For PMI, we anticipate a total shipment volume decline in 2018 at the low end of the total industry decline range, with a decrease for cigarettes partly offset by the strong growth of heated tobacco units. Our total international market share was essentially stable last year, following a decline in 2016 that primarily reflected pressure on our low margin brands in the Philippines, which has since abated. The growing contribution of heated tobacco units to our total share was clearly visible in 2017, reaching 0."
1,"For Q1 2018, we expect revenue to decline 3% to 7% sequentially as growth from both of our SSD and the eMMC controllers are more than offset by the seasonal decline of our SSD solutions. For full year 2018, we expect revenue to increase 5% to 10% led by strong growth from both our SSD controller and SSD solutions and stable eMMC controller sales, offset somewhat by declining memory card and flash drive controller sales. Let me reiterate that while we expect NAND supply to continue increasing and NAND prices to continue falling, we do not have good visibility on how fast and how much prices will fall."
1,"For Q1, we expect operating margins to be slightly higher than Q1 of 2017. We expect Q1 to be the low point of our consolidated operating margins and then to experience a steady, but steep ramp through the remainder of 2018 as service revenues decline. We expect first quarter interest expense to be approximately $5 million which includes all non-cash amounts."
1,"For Q4, we will have 385 campus minds joining us. We will continue our focus on operational efficiency and we expect quarter four margin to be stable. With this, I conclude the update."
1,"For the fourth quarter, it proved to be our highest quarter for loan growth as we delivered $182 million of net growth on $230 million of new originations. Asset quality remained strong with no delinquent loans or NPAs, so our margins have remained relatively steady. The strong loan demand in the fourth quarter also means that we closed the year with a robust pipeline putting us on good footings to start 2018."
1,"For the full year 2017, total non-GAAP revenue grew 43% to $177 million. Gross margins were consistent at 81% and we delivered steady improvement in our operating loss margin, moving from a loss of 10% to 2% of revenue. Additionally, we generated over $6 million in cash from operation."
1,"For the non-indexed business is our duty of course, and we have been improving to you, it is a market that we are doing it is our duty of course to put on the pricing evolution to manage and the level of gross margin per unit that we want to achieve. And of course that to achieve our 2020 objective, we said that our gross margin per unit should remain stable."
1,"For the quarter, we continue to see yield expansion in our new loan portfolio; however, we saw margin pressure resulting from the funding cost and a slight decline in the yield on our securities portfolio. Overall, the balance sheet remains positioned for margin expansion in a rising rate environment as we continue to predominantly be a variable rate lender and grow our stable demand and time deposit balances. With another high-quality quarter behind us and year behind us, our continued success remains rooted in our strong human capital and operational discipline as we continue to deliver consistent quality and sustainable results."
1,"For the year, our distributions are also fully covered by GAAP net investment income. The fourth quarter saw a continuation of recent trends with the leverage loan market supported by capital inflows, low interest rates and stable issuer fundamentals. The lack of new money opportunities combined with below average default rates and slow but steady economic growth have extended the issuer-friendly underwriting environment."
1,"Fort Worth, Raleigh, Phoenix and Richmond stood out for the group. Renter demand remained steady and move-outs by our current residents continue to remain low. Move-outs for overall same-store portfolio were down 6% for the quarter."
1,"fourth quarter reporting season are positive including important brands, Target, Urban Outfitters, L Brands, Lululemon and Tiffanys. For the year, foot traffic remains strong, being stable across the Flagship portfolio and slightly down in our Regional portfolio. Comparable net operating income growth for the portfolio was up 2."
1,"Free cash flow of AUD 71 million was lower due to high capital expenditure, which I'll talk to next and lower proceeds on the sale of assets with the prior year including the sale of our Boral CSR Bricks joint venture. Dividends paid increased to AUD 141 million as a result of our commitment to hold the final 2017 dividend steady as we completed the Headwaters acquisition, which was paid on significantly high number of shares. Turning to capital, we continue to maintain disciplined approach to capital management ."
1,"From 100% of our portfolio located in Ontario in 1997, our properties now span Canada from coast to coast with a presence in two international markets, Ireland and the Netherlands. If you turn to slide 20, we've also increased our presence in the higher return luxury and mid-tier demographic segment while building a strong presence in the stable and growing manufactured housing community market. This focused transition has contributed to our growing cash flows over the last 20 years."
1,"From a hereditary cancer perspective, revenue was up slightly on a sequential basis as volume growth was offset by the remaining price reductions in our long-term contracts. The second quarter fully reflected the pricing in our long-term contracts, and therefore we anticipate stable pricing for the remaining duration of these three-year contracts. Importantly, this was the fourth straight quarter with year-over-year volume growth."
1,"From a revenue perspective, core growth was 2% on a constant-currency basis, even after absorbing a modest impact from Hurricane Maria and a challenging comparison in our Front Line Care business. While we made very good progress in establishing a more stable and diversified business, our continued focus is on driving accelerated top line growth over the course of this year and during our long-range plan period. I'm pleased with the momentum we continue to build in our international business where all three businesses contributed to core revenue growth of 8% on a constant-currency basis."
1,"From an investment perspective standing here or quite close to here, a year ago, we saw scope for considerable volatility in 2017, as the possible impacts of a newly sworn in Donald Trump, Brexit, and European elections lay before us. As it turned out markets were pretty steady and positive overall albeit with the help of a slight rush of blood in the last quarter, and this is all reflected in our 2017 results. As a regular attendee of Rathbone's internal asset allocation and investment committees, I've seen it first-hand how well our teams have reacted to the ebbs and flows of the investment markets in 2017."
1,"From an SD&A perspective, we have continued to invest in our business. Our head count, on our salaried head count has been pretty stable here over the last six months. We haven't really meaningfully changed that."
1,"Full-year net charge-offs improved versus last year. We drove continued growth in our secured lending, which reached 43% of the total portfolio at year-end, reflecting the steady growth of our Direct Auto product. And loan receivables grew by more than $1."
1,"Further, I would like to emphasize our historical performance through various resin cycles. Over the past two years, resin prices have fluctuated over an average of 30% and during that same time period, our LTM operating EBITDA margin have been in a steady range of 18% to 19%. These historic reference point demonstrate our ability to pass-through resin cost changes to our customers mitigating the impact on Berry's earnings."
1,"Further, our domestic revenues grew by 29% during the quarter. In the nine months FY 2018, revenues were stable at INR 737 crores, so quarterly performance assisted as to recover from our subdued performance in the first half of the year. We expect business momentum to remain steady in quarter four, which would further enable us to close the year on a healthy note."
1,"Furthermore, because of our success, our products have become established within the industry as a common framework for defining and measuring investment risk and return. The framework that we deliver to our clients provides, for example, a framework for defining the universe of investable equity securities provided by our All Country World Index or ACWI, a common language for defining  and measuring the performance of a specific market or strategy such as that provided by our equity and real estate benchmark  indexes, a common language for understanding the absolute and relative environmental, social and government attributes of an issuer of securities such as that provided by our ES&G content and indexes and a common language for defining and understanding the systematic drivers of risk and return in a security or a portfolio through our widely accepted multi-asset class risk platform, our world-renowned factor models, and our recently introduced Factor Box and Factor Classification system for commonly used factors. Because our offerings provide frameworks for analyzing aspects of the investment process, a broad range of participants within the investment industry provide us with their thoughts and insights."
1,"Gas, I think, has something to do with it. So what's your thought process on gas margins kind of intrinsically relative to trend, I guess, on a dollar basis, or a penny per gallon basis in the current environment with relatively stable gas prices, particularly as you come up against, I guess, some more normalized comparison in the second half of the year?"
1,"Generally speaking, our total member investments average around $4 billion. Our member investments are stable and reliable, offering CFC funding with little reinvestment risk as our members have historically, consistently invested a large portion of their excess funds with CFC. Our federal government based funding increased by $74 million at November 30, 2017 from the prior fiscal year period."
1,"Generally, investor interests led us to our latest CD33 initiative, which is studying Actimab in combination with CLAG-M in relapsed or refractory AML patients. As you can see, this expands our presence in AML and significantly expands the adjustable patient population in our program. And keeping with our strategy of collaborating with key physician scientists, we'll first study this exciting combination in a Phase 1 investigator-initiated trial led by Dr."
1,"Going forward, the new tax laws provide a significant benefit to our tax rate under our current business structure. We estimate that with no change to our structure, our steady state annual tax rate will decline by approximately 200 basis points to 300 basis points resulting a future effective tax rate in the mid-20s with cash taxes expected to be in the mid-to-high teens before discrete items. As we've discussed in the past, we would prefer a C-corp structure for Lazard for a number of reasons."
1,"Going to the next slide, slide 5, our mining production was stronger in the fourth quarter, reaching 154,000 tons of zinc equivalent, 11% higher than in the third quarter of 2017, and in line with fourth quarter of 2016, helping us to recover part of the production losses we had during the year. Our smelting sales were pretty stable during the quarter, with our three smelters operating without interruptions and in full capacity. Revenues reflect the strong increase in base metal prices."
1,"Good morning and thank you, all, for joining us to review our fourth quarter and full year 2017 performance and add some color to our 2018 outlook based on our read of current market conditions which we view is fundamentally stable across all of our end markets. Fourth quarter results met or exceeded our expectations that we laid out on the October and December outlook calls."
1,"Good morning, everyone. Our goal remains and has always been to maintain a stable net asset value and generate investment income above our distribution. While we had elevated repayment activity in 2017 as Bilal just discussed, our pipeline is strong."
1,"Good morning, Robert. The mix is going to be about the same, pretty stable when you look at our different product families in business aircraft. And we are going to deliver a handful of 7000 this year."
1,"Good results, everyone. I was wondering if we could speak a little bit about the top three customers in the quarter, looks like they were all stable and maybe in particular your largest customer showed increased stability. I was wondering if you could provide in the 2018 outlook what you're expecting for your top three customers, do you expect to see growth in that group?"
1,"Got it. And on the price mix in the quarter, your price increases over the course of this year seemed to be pretty steady, but I'm wondering if there was any mix impact from strength in morning, which I assume to be a slightly smaller ticket than what you would see in the afternoon."
1,"Got it. And then, separately in New Mexico, and I'm just wondering your customer growth continues to be steady as you said. Any sense that the usage patterns or whatever energy efficiency impacts are stabilizing, we're still in the negative category and your guidance range for load is flat to down still, but anything you can point to to say, hey, maybe we've bottomed out on the load growth trend there?"
1,"Great question. So, just to summarize, we've had very strong progress in the financial services segment of our business, and we've seen a steady expansion of market share within Virtusa in terms of financial services. There are primarily two things that are driving this."
1,"Great. And last one, I don't know if you're going to be able to say anything about this, but the book value I think for the group was reasonably stable in the fourth quarter and I think you guys were within $0. 03 of our estimate, obviously the first quarter has been a different event for everyone, I'm just curious if you can give any color as to sort of the magnitude of what's happened to your book value, so far this year since that is going to be taken into consideration on the dividend?"
1,"Gross profit increased 36% year-over-year, resulting in gross profit margin of 13%, up about 230 basis points, and finally returning to the mid-teens minimum level we have anticipated for a number of years. Solid demand, pricing discipline and a steady focus on investment and cost control continue to fuel our healthy operational and financial outlook across the business. Now before I turn to our 2018 outlook, let me offer just a little more color on a few notable items as we enter the year."
1,"Growth in personal loans should allow us to generate a higher ROE revenue stream and help us achieve a better balance between our commercial and consumer portfolios. In the first quarter, we expect total end-of-period consumer loans to be stable relative to the fourth quarter. For 2018, we expect end-of-period loan growth of between 2% and 3%."
1,Growth in the first three quarters of the year in markets and banking enabled both to withstand the effects of subdued market activity in the fourth quarter. Global Private Banking adjusted revenue continued to reflect the impact of historical repositioning but was broadly stable over the course of 2017 and grew by 10% in our target markets. Adjusted loan impairment charges were significantly lower than 2016 due mainly to improved conditions in the oil and gas industry in North America.
1,"Gulf Coast; Dawn; Chicago; a little bit on AECO this year, only 1%; and, of course, Malin, California. So, we're really not looking at AECO price, we're looking at NYMEX price, which of course, has been initially steady and now actually very strong, and so we're very pleased with that. And I'll just remind you that even though only 30% of our production comes from the condensate, 70% of our revenue comes from the condensate because of that premium to West Texas, and we hedged that as well."
1,"He'll expedite our transformation, while laying the groundwork for future strategic investment. I'd also like to thank Ken Jacobson for the outstanding job that he did as Interim CFO as we made steady progress on our financial commitments under his leadership. Now, I'd like to turn the commentary over to Ken to provide more color on our financial performance."
1,"Hey, Jade, this is Steve. As the portfolio matures, we will be seeing more and more prepayments such that when we get to a steady state in the future, we should be expecting something like 25% of the portfolio to prepay over the course of the year. This quarter..."
1,"Historically, you've assessed surplus capital at year-end. Do we think now this could be more of an interim assessment given your pretty steady capital generation? And then, finally..."
1,"However, due to our policy of expensing commissions and bonuses when we incur them, operating profit suffered a bit. The strong cloud bookings also helped us drive up our services backlog and maintenance again held steady. Daniel will give the numbers and I'll discuss the details."
1,"However, due to these de-installs and due to our installation backlog going out of the year, our installed base only grew slightly over 2016. Moving forward, at our new and stronger order rate and with a strong installation backlog going into 2018, we look forward to steady growth in our U. S."
1,"However, in Q4 earnings in our ag business in Brazil improved considerably. Ladies and gentlemen, you know that we are committed to our dividend policy, which means we want to increase the dividend year-over-year or at least keep it stable. At this year's Shareholder Meeting, we will propose to pay a dividend of â‚¬3."
1,"However, our average transaction fee on closed deals was significantly higher compared with the same quarter last year. We continue to see broad-based restructuring activity across several of our industry verticals with oil and gas returning to a more steady state revenue stream for the quarter. In Financial Advisory Services, revenues were $36 million for the quarter, a 4% increase from the prior year."
1,"However, the transition of the credit function to an outsourced model has led to operational issues that significantly impacted our same-store sales. We are making steady progress fixing these issues and have seen some signs of improvement in credit participation and application volumes in February versus fourth quarter trends, although still below prior-year levels. We do continue to expect the transition to be a headwind during fiscal year 2019 as we work through change management in the stores."
1,"I   well, two things. One is, I think that we believe that it's stabilizing right now even though you know there was a fair amount of activity in the fourth quarter, it seems to be a more stable pricing environment now as we come into 2018. And overall, the   as sell-out improves, which we expect to occur at some point in time with the favorable macro conditions that we see for the tire industry, I think that we'll begin to see a recovery in pricing relative to raw materials."
1,"I also want to highlight our high revenue growth in 2017. As you can see in the purple bars, rental income has increased as a result of completed projects and rising rents, and when our costs are stable or even falling, our cash flow and those our dividend based earnings, will increase by the order of SEK 200 million. Ã…sa will now tell us more about the 2017 performance."
1,"I am Vijay Sankeshwar, Chairman and Managing Director of VRL Logistics Limited. Since four, five years, we are under lot of pressure that market was not stable and lot of changes, demonetization, recently GST and all, lot of people were under confusion and all. And we were not in a position to go to market or marketing executives since last five, six years, because hundreds of my competitors who are in mid-size, they're carrying so many illegal bill and without bill and all that."
1,"I cannot tell you at this point that we are really pushing hard on this price increase. In terms of price/cost spread, stable for Interior Solution division overall this year, you can derive from what I said, the goal is to do that and maybe to do even a little bit better and all our efforts are in this direction. I will give you the results when we know it."
1,"I didn't get the feel that anybody was banking on the Trump Bill, and most of our orders have been steady, good activity particularly the mobile side is our Roadtec division, Carlson is very strong. So, I don't think that they're working with Trump in mind as they are executing right now."
1,"I don't perceive step function increases in those investments. I think we're going to make steady progress, but we're going to keep our eye on the price. And to the extent that we can invest in a way that delivers really good returns for shareholders, we're going to do that."
1,"I don't think there was anything abnormal in December or even in January this year, no. So, it looks pretty stable at the moment, with maybe a little bit of a glimmer of hope around the prospect for us getting involved in a bit more new business at our pricing."
1,"I don't think we've really seen that in our direct results. Yes, I think so far our growth has been fairly stable and predictable. I think   I do think it's probably more likely than not that we're closer to the top of the cycle than the bottom."
1,"I guess the other thing I would say, and look, I mean, I think the 5 times and Kim can talk about this the 5 times is a bit   there's a bit of a magic number quality to that in terms of how the rating agencies view eligibility for an upgrade at that point. But I do think, and I think they take this into account, I think equity investors should take this into account, when you look at the network of assets that we have and how diversified they are and how stable they are, yeah, there are headwinds in some places and tailwinds in the others, but we're diversified in our exposure to all the major things and good things that are happening in North American energy. I think that set of stable assets in the way we've contracted them out gives us a little bit more stability than somebody else with a different set of assets at 5 times."
1,"I guess what I'm interested in and maybe better understanding, especially since you're staying in the business within your expectations, is it possible for example that in Q2 we're actually looking at a provision for credit losses at the high-end of the range, let's say 30. And then, in the back half of the year, watch it fall back down to the bottom end of your range or will it be a little more stable than that?"
1,"I have worked for Mitch for almost 20 years. In the early years, with the team producing as many as 22 new Walmart stores in a year, today, it is those very Walmart stores and their steady cash flow and draw of customers to our shopping centers that serve as a strong base, while this same development team carries out this ambitious mixed use development program. Mitch and lifestyle experience, expertise and industry connections complement each other and when combined with the internal integrated team of planners, engineers, architects, construction, leasing, analysts, accountants and legal, many of which have been with us for much of that 20 years."
1,"I just want to also stress that PRT is one component of our RIS business. We have other components of this business that continue to perform strongly, stable value, for example, structured settlements, and our capital markets business as well. So, that's one component of our overall RIS business."
1,I know there was some lost sales in the September quarter. Is there any way of telling how much of recapturing of lost sales took place in this quarter or is it your opinion that this was just a nice steady improvement throughout the quarter?
1,"I mean with   I mean consistent markets, here I would say that the comp line, given the initiatives we have going on is, will not move, it's pretty stable with the run rate as well as those fourth quarter expenses I think are fairly stable with the run rate, although we're still looking at other initiatives, which will update you on as we move throughout 2018. We're still committed to this, $30 million to $40 million reduction."
1,"I mean, I don't want to call out specific retailers, but it's pretty well-publicized about companies like that that are going through a transition. I will say you look at our top 25 in our supplemental and for the most part, they're solid, they're stable. A company like L Brands had some sales decreases last year, but they just came out with a really strong print for January."
1,"I mean, so you referred to different allocation. So, I am just trying to understand, will the absolute amount be stable, but there will be higher allocation to one part of your business? Or will the absolute amount increase, but allocation may not remain same."
1,"I mean, the â‚¬75 million, as you can see, that's why we outlined with this effect coming out of the sale of real estate which was adding another â‚¬16 million. Overall, we would say that we have really reduced our corporate line, but going forward, we would say a stable line is still somewhat above â‚¬100 million. So, even if you adjust for the â‚¬16 million, the overall run rate per quarter is still slightly above â‚¬100 million."
1,"I mean, this speaks to the strength of the new portfolio. And we will keep our margins stable before the U. S."
1,"I mean, we need to get the wood that we need in order to supply our industries, and we've been good at that in the past, and I think we'll be that also going forward. And, I mean, prices will vary over time and, as it is just now, we can just say that we have a stable price in our area and that is not really the case when we look around us. But in our area, it's reasonably stable."
1,"I mean, when you look at the retail time deposits and when I say retail, the deposit not traded on the secondary market that is something that exists here in Chile. In that market, we are close from 20% to 21% market share, I mean, the deposit coming from the, say, by our whole clients, basically retail are more stable ones. So that's with market share we target, that is in line with the market share we have on the asset side."
1,"I mentioned earlier that we have low exposure to private label. You can see five out of our 14 categories have private label exposure, but generally they're very stable, not growing. Now, innovation, always a good story for us."
1,"I plan with a stable number. If you look at our multiyear budget has a number stable over time. So, we feel comfortable sharing the message with you, stable number."
1,"I think across the board, our FTE, sorry not the tax equivalent, full-time equivalent or staffing assumptions are relatively stable year-on-year. So, the inflation that I refer to is probably just more in terms of market based merit increases but without significant incremental investment."
1,"I think after a few difficult years, 2016 marked a trough of that evolution, and 2017 has been a positive year for us where we have had positive like-for-likes throughout the year. And we have managed to regain a competitive position while keeping our margins stable. We are also moving and we made the first few tests of new proximity stores in Lisbon in November and December."
1,I think it's basically a variation on the answer I gave a moment ago. Our production from our areas is basically steady at the moment. And it's mainly as a result of the work that we've done with the government and with Ecopetrol.
1,"I think it's fair to say that if you look on our target and our expected growth of the portfolio is we can see a stable market around the unsecured consumer debt, and then, majority of the growth will come from what we would call adjacent asset classes that is secured and SME-related assets. And we see a clear picture in Europe where a lot of our clients is coming to us today and talk about more mixed type of portfolios so that would be clearly a growth area for us."
1,"I think it's important for some people on our shareholder call to have continuous and solid and steady growth. Clearly, there are elements of the brand space which is a little bit more expensive to go into, takes longer to build, but once it's in place is more sustainable."
1,"I think it's one of the keys to the success and quality of the system in Australia that there is that balance between public and private provision. In relation to health funds, Ramsey is in a stable reimbursement environment for the next year, with most of our major funding arrangements not due for renegotiation till next calendar year. In terms of the operational outlook for Australia, I remain positive."
1,"I think on the attribution side, one comment I will tell you that we're really pleased with McClatchy and tronc transitions because what we're finding there is that the dealer bodies haven't been fully aware of all the progress that we've made here. As you've noted that we've had more steady decline in our affiliate business than we have in our direct. And I think the absence of dedicated service and support and communication of value is one of the chief culprits."
1,"I think our crude oil business, I would expect that to be fairly stable."
1,"I think our labor supply is steady with quality relationships and they have demonstrated an ability to continue to grow as we grow. Additionally, we're able to attract additional subcontractors and suppliers."
1,"I think that we'll be providing updates on that in the future and I think the main reason is that that level of longer term CapEx depends not only on our asset sales and how the size of the corporate portfolio changes in the coming years, but more importantly our pace of new development, which really would drive that CapEx number. As it relates to our regular way maintenance capital investment for the company, as well as just our core IT investment, we expect that to be pretty stable. And I do not expect certainly annual IT investments like we have guided for this year."
1,"I think that, generally speaking, they're all active on some level. But what we typically see is a customer spending a lot when another customer spends a little bit less and they kind of offset each other or one customer spending a lot on macro towers and the other spending on small cells and that kind of offsets each other, but generally, a relatively steady growth trend, which is why we feel pretty comfortable with our medium-term growth that we talk about. And we don't see any big moves one way or the other, like there's one year that our carrier customers spend 100% more than they've spent a year before."
1,"I think the best way to answer is to look at our production last year. In Q1 2017   since Q1 2017, our production's remained steady quarter-by-quarter. That's thanks to a lot of work in the field and excellent collaboration with our partner Ecopetrol and the full support of the Colombian government, and we're planning to continue with the same approaches in 2018."
1,"I think there is a   CapEx guidance, obviously we've got some synergy CapEx that will go away, so that will definitely help going forward. Our cooler run rate's pretty stable, I don't expect that to step up. And I am pleased that in that CapEx guidance is a significant increase in our IT expenditure."
1,"I think there is a lot about base of comparison going there. Our business is much more stable and keeps going up and up and developing in growth and profit because while we invest a lot in this business in innovation, now it goes with the full connectivity to the EcoStruxure Power that links everything from Medium Voltage to Secure Power going through Low Voltage. So we've got the full system for that."
1,I think there was some timing move from the third quarter. If you could just give us kind of a little bit of an outlook in that business and would you expect you guys pointed to a stable market impact overall in the fourth quarter. Would you expect exposures and prices to move when we think about the market impact for 2018?
1,"I think we reported we saw 6%, overall, quarter-over-quarter. But we saw steady acceleration during the quarter which is very encouraging on iOS."
1,I think what John was referring to when he said stable margins were from 2016 to 2017 and in the fourth quarter specifically of 2016 versus 2017. We do see margins increasing into 2018.
1,"I think you have to look at it in a couple of ways. Number one as you've seen the change in the overall branch footprint, the number of ATMs that are actually deployed and under service contract has been quite stable and increasing over the last number of years because you still have to have the touch point with your customers. And so you still see the branches being an important aspect of that."
1,"I think you'll notice we're calling NAFTA combines to continue to remain strong and be up 10% as farm incomes remain stable, leading to no significant changes expected in planted acreage. With the recent weakness in the USD versus other agricultural producing regions, currencies and the current negotiations on NAFTA and TPP, we can expect that our forecast despite calling acreage to be stable to have some volatility, but at current capacity utilization projections, we have the capacity to respond. Construction equipment demand is forecasted to be up 5% to 10% on LATAM and APAC while remaining flat to up in both EMEA and NAFTA based on our order books, the NAFTA number may be conservative, but we'll update that when we get to the end of Q1."
1,"I think you've kind of partially answered the second half of the question, which was very much that if we look mechanically, the price tailwind in Germany and UK, your two key markets, looks like it's smaller in 2018 versus 2017. But your OCF growth guidance is stable-ish. And Charlie already mentioned that there's a possibility that actually Lightning isn't a big tailwind if you're successful ironically."
1,"I think, Kathy made a reference to this before, but let me just make a more general comment, which is that, what we expect to see with our vectors in the setting of a disease like hemophilia is that, after a period of increasing factor activity, that a patient's levels reach a steady state and that typically occurs we've seen around 12 weeks, give or take something, around 12 weeks, and then thereafter, the levels are stable. We've obviously seen that as we've demonstrated and published longer term follow-up data with SPK-9001 in hemophilia B."
1,I wanted to start off by asking about the OpEx line. That line held relatively stable even though your revenues beat our expectations. And so I just wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about how you expect that to move in the future.
1,"I was asked earlier whether there's some seasonality. You know, there's a little bit of seasonality just in the normal course of the year, but overall, I think it's very stable. And the most important thing about fuels distribution I think not everybody in the market has picked up is that it is a service contract, so it comes with no maintenance capital."
1,"I will conclude with a brief discussion on our expectations of market performance and company specific guidance. Regarding our planning assumptions and guidance for 2018, we expect that the present range for petroleum prices will persist for the foreseeable future causing oil and gas customer spend for inspection services to be relatively stable. Information obtained from our North American oil and gas customers suggests that their spending in the first half of 2018 will continue to improve over 2017 and our results are expected to reflect this dynamic."
1,I would also say that part of our strategy has been running a steady operation and we think the size and scale of that gives us preferred pricing and doesn't really involve locking things in. It involves being somebody that runs a steady program.
1,"I would say that it is from a   from the bank point of view, I see no reason to change the level of management buffer. So, I think the issue is, of course, that if we look on our capital requirements and so on, where we now have a somewhat more stable period, I think you should also   you should remember that we are in an important transition from one big leader to another and that is an issue we, of course, need to be prudent around. So, we want to wait and see what that means, in terms of, I think, being able to recommend any other type of stance on how to view the size of the management buffer."
1,"I would say, retail sales in Q4 in UK were fairly poor, overall, and certainly down, I think, relative to what we've seen over the course of the year. That's not an uncommon phenomenon in the UK, frankly, heading into the winter season after a strong tourism season this past summer, but I think we would view the overall market as fairly stable. I think we remain very pleased with how our business is performing there."
1,"I'd like to point out that we see both Great Bay and Amherst as adding further diversity to our non-regulated power production fleet, both by geography and generating source. The diversity of our generating portfolio remains a key element of our continued delivery of stable long-term financial results. And the last one I'd like to speak about is Granite Bridge."
1,"Ideally even on the run rate basis the past three quarters or two quarters the margin that we have done in 2Q and 3Q even if you were to sustain that in FY 2019, you would do better than FY 2018 total margins. And your response to that is that R&D cost and all, but your R&D costs you are guiding to be stable, right at 6% of sale. So where is that extra sort of cost being incurred in your budgets that you feel that the margin expansion for full year FY 2018 versus full year FY 2019 may not be there?"
1,"If oil prices are viewed to be stable at these higher levels, it is possible we may see a return to formations that would require more industrial gasses, but we just aren't seeing much of that yet. South America, 13% of our sales has been stable, but the 2018 election season in Brazil will likely provide some volatility during the year. Industrial activity still remains at multiyear lows, but the recent trend has improved with low- to mid-single digit IP growth over the last few months."
1,"If that trend were to continue, and I'm not suggesting it will, but we are trying to really focus on very high-quality investments, as you might imagine, and sometimes that requires you being in more in the 11%-s than the 13%-s. And so, I think   we feel like our yields are pretty stable. We could see a little bit of a decline from where we are today for sure."
1,"If we can do that over the next three years, just on that alone, organic growth will move our leverage to about 2. 5 times EBITDA, but also provide additional top line growth, also provide incremental improvement in our EBIDTA margin and just make us a better, more stable, more dense routes."
1,"If we look at our consolidated revenue line items, we expect the following. System revenue should be stable as a result of both healthy multiplexing system placements within our expected range and the inclusion of both ARIES and VERIGENE system sales. Consumable revenues are expected to grow at mid-single digit rates."
1,"If you actually take that out that, our ROA, ROE is roughly the same as it was earlier, in fact slightly higher. So, the regular business   our steady stream business actually is generating attractive and consistent ROA, ROE. The new business investment has depressed it slightly for this quarter, but we believe that this is   we will get expansion in margins going forward."
1,"If you compare our numbers to industry average numbers, I think it is clear that, that has been our focus and will continue to be our focus going forward. And that is, of course, a constant thing that you have to monitor, where you see that the market is going and because   and as I said, I think, already in the last call, I mean, a stable volume that we have, I think, also gives a lot of benefits on the cost side and the cost outside. So, there is definitely a continued interest for us to have the right balance."
1,"If you exclude the single commercial credit that was subject to a Department of Justice investigation in the first quarter, were 9 basis points if you include that credit. On slide 4, our adjusted pre-provision net revenue reflects steady improvement, up 19% from the year ago quarter, and if previously referenced larger charitable contribution is excluded, pre-tax pre-provision net revenue increased 25% from year ago quarter. Some of the growth is due to the benefits of securities purchases, which we do not expect to be a significant contributor to growth over the foreseeable future."
1,"If you look at last year, we will come with the exact market share numbers with Q1, but with the information we have today, in units we're probably about stable, but it's clear that when we look at monetary value, I think we took share. And that's clearly   was our objective as well that when you have a stable or actually slightly declining market, then it very seldom makes sense to go for unit market share than you want to go for value market share. That's what we have done."
1,"If you look at the left side of this slide, short-term pricing has remained strong through the winter with prices clearing today higher than a year ago despite global LNG supply growing almost 30 million tonnes, 2017. And our positioning on the Gulf Coast with stable low-cost feedstock and our proven ability to source it positions us well to capture incremental demand. Finally, on the right side of the slide, we look to synthesize these dynamics with our capabilities to capture long-term growth opportunities."
1,"If you look at the left side of this slide, short-term pricing has remained strong through the winter with prices clearing today higher than a year ago despite global LNG supply growing almost to 30 million tonnes 2017. And our positioning on the Gulf Coast with stable low cost feedstock and our proven ability to source it positions us well to capture incremental demand. Finally, on the right side of the slide, we look to synthesize these dynamics with our capabilities to capture long-term growth opportunities."
1,"If you think about making a difference in the environment and the ecology, making a difference for our workforce and in the communities that we serve and operate in, and making a difference economically, when you match those things together, you create something that we call a virtuous cycle for growth; sustainability, fueling the growth of the business, providing access to new customers and consumers, and enabling us to be more efficient in our operations. There's a dynamism in that that creates a momentum, and our team internally at Tyson is galvanized around the idea of sustainability, fueling profitable, stable, long-term growth. And if we're being honest with ourselves, this is moving from the realm of nice to have to a requirement."
1,"I'll give the margin question to, Don. But the way I'm thinking about FlexVolt at this point, it's going to be a steady contributor to our organic growth as time goes on, and at this point, it's hard to really understand FlexVolt versus 20 volt versus corded. And what are all the dynamics other than we know what's already been said, which is, it's a positive mix of effects."
1,"I'll take that. So over the last two years, our supply-chain finance has been extremely stable actually between Â£150 million and Â£175 million. It is increasingly in demand\\\\ by our supply chain, and for a number of them it's their preferred method of contracting."
1,"I'm joined by Heath Hill, our CFO. Shipments during the fourth quarter continued at a steady pace, as our customers took their contracted coal. The mild start to winter reduced electricity demand and coal burn in Q4."
1,"I'm joined by my colleague, Carlo Crosetto. Our year-end closing is already stable enough to be able to give you the most important key figures to-date. I will start as usual by summarizing the highlights and providing an overview of our results for 2017."
1,"I'm not here baking any excuses. It was a management decision and with that number alone would have put us in a profitable operating situation and a steady growth by our large OEM customer who was in that hit the fourth quarter in our plant utilization part. We did 30   if you had asked me this in first quarter, I think for second quarter, I was bullish."
1,"I'm pleased to report that the fourth quarter of 2017 was another strong quarter for Buckeye solid performance across all of our businesses that resulted in a record year. Our diversification strategy continues to yield strong as stable results through varying commodity cycles. Before I talk about our results and plans moving forward, I want to recognize a great performance in 2017 around safety and operations at Buckeye."
1,"I'm thinking stable more from like the last four years stable, and thinking more   both   the third quarter was very strong, the fourth quarter was strong and impacted by recoveries. So if you look at where we had been in the prior three years, that's kind of where our head is at."
1,"I'm very pleased with the improved relationships that we have with the senior leaders in government and we're talking together with a mutual objective of reaching a solution. From our standpoint, we have a contract that remains in place that gives us certain enforcement rights, but we're working to find a way of meeting some of the objectives of the government of Indonesia for its fiscal policies, its national aspirations in a way that meets our objectives of giving us an assurance of long-term operating rights with fixed and supportable and stable fiscal and legal terms and would allow us to operate this business in a way to maximize its resource. In some ways, it's like a new project."
1,"Importantly, our third quarter results only included two months of the Clayton Banks' relatively higher cost of deposits and thus, on an apples-to-apple basis, our deposit data in the fourth quarter was minimal. As we continue to focus on growing customer deposits in this competitive environment, we expect our deposit cost ticking up slightly but remain confident that our steady low cost funding base will remain a strength. As Chris noted in his opening comments, we had an excellent quarter from our banking, mortgage banking operations as highlighted on slide 8."
1,"Improvement measures across the industry are having effect and we see more projects being sanctioned. There is steady tailoring in our activity in our main markets and we are currently bidding for contracts totaling about NOK 50 billion even afterwards. About two-thirds of this in the subsea area and we expect to see some key projects to be sanctioned over the next six months particularly Norway, South America, Asia Pacific, and some countries in Africa."
1,"In 2017, we also assisted a number of organizations when it came to the compliance with GDPR. If you look at our top 10 clients, the share of our top 10 clients remains stable. A new client here is ABN AMRO, the European Commission, and the Port of Rotterdam which are now a part of our top 10."
1,"In 2017, we set new operational performance records for safety, reliability, and environmental stewardship. Our accomplishments in these areas exemplify Valero's commitment to premier operations and are key drivers that enable us to deliver more stable earnings. Also in 2017, we invested $2."
1,"In a year where competitive headwinds lead to tighter credit spreads, higher leverage and lower covenant quality in the middle market lending space, we attribute that robustness of our 2017 financial results to have disciplined underwriting and capital allocation process. By maintaining our investment selectivity and commitment to thematic sourcing and underwriting, we've been able to generate stable, attractive portfolio yields and ROEs despite the challenge in operating environment. Bo and Ian will discuss this in more detail later on in the call."
1,"In addition we are trailblazing to fully leverage AI capabilities to drive more and a faster pace of product innovation such as the brand new text-to-speech version of the Baidu app. On the advertising front, we continue to make steady improvements to our advertising product offerings and ad platform to drive sustained growth in search and the feed monetization. For example, we have seen strong adoption of dynamic ads."
1,"In addition, we are introducing two metrics, pre-provision operating income and pre-provision operating yield, to evaluate the performance of our operations independent of reserve releases or builds and the impact of loan growth on provision expense. Finally, we have retired the steady state metrics we introduced during our Analyst Day in 2016, which were historically helpful for demonstrating the financial potential of our business as we shifted away from our marketplace funding strategy in 2016. Now, on to guidance, as it relates to our financial outlook for 2018, our priority is to maintain a substantial level of adjusted net income, while profitably growing loan balances and expanding our pre-provision operating yield."
1,"In addition, we wrapped up 2017 with strong cash flow of $5. 3 million that helps put our financial operations in a steady position as we move into 2018. Speaking of MU3, I want to address the current language and the continuing resolution for the budget proposal in regards to advancing stages of meaningful use."
1,"In Asia, very, very stable, a slight tick-up in the Commercial Banking space in Hong Kong, but again, not characterized by anything in particular that would be worth bringing out. So I think, overall, other than the notable items that we mentioned in the fourth quarter, it's a pretty stable picture. I think it would be entirely accurate to say that   but learning from that experience in the fourth quarter, we are   as our credit teams always do   taking a good look at secondary order impacts that may emanate from particularly one of those names, but at this point in time, a reasonably stable picture."
1,"In California, we have also begun to strengthen our land positions by acquiring additional lots since entering that market. All of our California markets which include the Bay Area, Central California and Southern California are experiencing steady traffic, sales and price appreciation trends driven by solid economic backdrops. Our Mountain region experienced solid growth with home sales revenues up 22% year-over-year."
1,"In China, we have seen increased environmental activity. So, overall, through own activities, capabilities and strengthening our way of working and our positioning, as well as a more stable demand in the market, reasonable positive outlook for the future."
1,"In closing as I look back on the last three years, I think it's important to recognize our achievements in technology and efficiency gains, principles applied and discipline employed, but also to recognize missteps we avoided. We did not dilute our shareholders to finance growth as we were financially stable. We carefully managed down our long term debt by divesting non-core assets and through operating cash flow, and added to our oil rich inventory and our portfolio through our exploration activities."
1,"In closing, I'm pleased with the third quarter results. Through our team's hard work and dedication, we're making steady progress on our strategic plan. NextGen has once again become a competitive player in an aggressive market, and I believe we have positioned the company appropriately to see a return to growth in the years to come."
1,"In Display, we remain the global leader. Our priority is to deliver stable returns and win in new Display categories. We expect 2018 to be another year of strong progress for our Display business."
1,"In fact, that reality has created interesting buying opportunities for us over the past 12 months. But with cap rates for high-quality, stable properties at the same levels as in 2016, give or take 25 basis points to 50 basis points, it made sense to sell a few of our stabilized Fund IV properties where we had already achieved our target multiple, liquidate at fair pricing properties in our older vintage funds, and take some chips off the table in Savannah, Georgia by selling a handful of properties where cap rates met or exceeded expectations. Fortunately, we've already sold a lot of our earlier vintage suburban assets and we're seeing increased interest from institutional investors for office and residential."
1,"In Individual Life, while results in 2017 were below what we anticipated due to adverse mortality and actions taken as part of our annual review of assumptions, this is a well-underwritten business and we continue to actively manage the composition of sales as the environment evolves. And turning to our International operations, we continue to deliver steady core growth and solid earnings and returns, including an ROE of 17% for 2017. We are particularly pleased at how our Japanese business adapted to price changes on Yen products in early 2017 through increased sales of foreign currency denominated products."
1,"In January 2018, our credit rating was upgraded. Our long-term rating improved from IND A- to IND A with a stable outlook. We expect the positive benefits of this upgrade to flow in the coming quarters."
1,"In last mile specifically, because of our large position in last mile, we're able to give steady miles to independent operators. So they gravitate towards us."
1,"In less than five years, the Choice Properties crew has built a high quality real estate business while consistently delivering results and growth in cash flows. We look forward to 2018 and another successful year of generating solid, stable and secure cash flows, while driving our growth through acquisitions and active management as well as our development program. We are excited with our mixed-use development projects and expect to share more progress with you in the year."
1,"In line with our commitment to secure digitization of our nation, our collaboration with government cybersecurity, Cyber Swachhta Kendra to offer a free bot removal tool has resulted in a 51% decrease in malware infection in all network across the country, which demonstrates our robustness of our products. Talking briefly about our Q3 performance, we have seen continued and steady growth in our revenue, driven by strong uptick of retail products by partner community, and following the stabilization of GST. In the enterprise and government segment, our strategy to focus on customer retention, while adding new customer had led positive results with Seqrite successfully retaining 80% of its customer."
1,"In our communication technologies business, we have developed leading-edge solutions to help customers deal with drone intrusions near airports and other sensitive airspaces, which is driving significant customer interest and a number of orders. In our Engineered Solutions segment, we continue to make good progress in our initiative to reposition our process cooling business towards sales of components and services, including higher margin, more stable demand products like our proprietary Geareducers, fans, heat exchange media, and other OEM and aftermarket components. With each new voice of the customer-driven product launch, we broaden our reach into new market opportunities and increase customer share of wallet."
1,"In Resources & Energy, third quarter profit was Â¥264. 3 billion, making steady progress towards the previous forecast, and supported by good performance at our Australian iron ore and coal operations, higher dividends from our LNG business, cost reductions and volume increases in our various energy businesses, and despite a one-time loss as a result of revisions to the U. S."
1,"In short, here are several reasons to be upbeat about the outlook for Highwoods. Economic growth nationally has been steady to increasing and across our Southeastern markets we've seen continued job growth and real estate fundamentals remain healthy. In particular, Nashville, Raleigh, Atlanta, and our Florida markets continue to post some of the highest job growth and population growth rates across the nation."
1,"In slide 11 of the presentation, we detailed out critical asset quality metrics. You will see that our asset quality has been favorable and relatively stable over the past five years. Also, we do not see any systemic issues in our diversified loan portfolio."
1,"In summary, we have essentially all of our 2018 volume under contract. We remain very pleased with the current dynamics in our Display business and our progress in maintaining stable returns. Let's move to Optical Communications."
1,"In summary, we made good progress in 2017 with broad-based revenue growth, positive operating leverage, earnings growth, and a sizable return of capital to our shareholders. Importantly, we continue to deepen our client relationships and lay the foundation for sustainable client-led growth and steady improvement in returns over time. We remain committed to our medium and longer-term return targets and expect to show continued progress in 2018."
1,"In summary, we remain focused on delivering the annual double-digit growth that we have accomplished for the last seven years. We see a stable operational environment, a massive amount of earnings upside available through improvement in our unseasoned stores, and a more robust acquisition market. These factors, coupled with the most liquidity in our history and sector-leading low leverage, gives us confidence that we can continue to drive significant top and bottom-line improvement."
1,"In terms of funding, we have very stable funding base. Our cost is very stable. You saw that we have increased our deposits."
1,"In terms of reserves and resources, they've been pretty flat in the last couple of years and they've actually been fairly stable probably over the last seven years or eight years. There's been some increases in certain years, but what's really probably been increasing is the capacity of the mill and the mine."
1,"In terms of salary build, I think we were fairly constrained in adding people throughout 2017. I think you could see that there is   our salaries and benefit plan was pretty stable throughout the year. And so you're seeing some impact of us finally making some investments there."
1,"In terms of the technical integration, we expect the VisaNet migration to begin this quarter and continue throughout 2018. We have planned carefully with our clients to ensure the highest standards of preparation and testing for the months leading up to the migration, with regular updates with the business leaders to ensure a smooth and stable migration. Once the migration is completed, we'll be able to deliver new products, services, and capabilities to the region, bringing the best of our global capabilities to our European clients."
1,"In the automotive industry, primarily we focus on the OEMs, the original equipment manufacturers, as well as the Tier 1 companies. In both these segments, we have seen a good up-tick in our services to be in a steady quarter. In the media and broadcast space, our primary markets are the operators, the multi-service operators and OEMs."
1,"In the following segment comments, the term adjusted EBITDA excludes severance and other downsizing charges. In our Well Site Services segment, we generated another quarter of sequentially improved results with revenues up 6% totaling $82 million, and adjusted segment EBITDA up 46% quarter-over-quarter, totaling $11 million, which exceeded the high end of our guided range These sequential improvements were driven by a 7% increase in the number of completion services jobs performed, a 2% increase in revenue per completion services job and steady utilization for our land drilling rigs, which averaged 31% for the quarter. Despite the flat to down U."
1,"In the fourth quarter, we completed one large sale project that contributed over $1 million of gross profit, which we do not expect to reoccur in Q1. So while the result in Q4 was quite strong, the overall trend line in our Other North America segment has been steady for the last four quarters. On the right hand side of the page, we're seeing stabilization of pricing and have three sequential quarters of unit on rent growth heading into 2018."
1,"In the next years due to the growing traction, growing interest and a promising pipeline, we expect to see growth of 15%. To summarize, the unparalleled benefit of ULE, the market recognitions that already recognized these benefits, the growing traction and the pipeline of ULE opportunities basically strengthens our belief that we will see a stable growth in the years to come. We are gaining traction with service providers, operators, the voice assistant, the ULE voice assistant."
1,"In the past, we were unable to quantify a liability associated with IBNR claims. However, our defense strategy continued to evolve over the past couple of years and that has produced a more stable claims experience, improved visibility and predictability of claims composition amongst other things that enabled us to make a reasonable estimate of the IBNR liability. As a result, we increased our product liability reserve for IBNR cumulative trauma product liability claims in the fourth quarter by a $111 million, which reflects our estimated liability through the year 2060."
1,"In the private real estate equity market, office transaction volume ended 2017 down 25% from 2016 levels, primarily due to less product available in the market. Though cap rates remain reasonably stable for leased assets in our core markets, many domestic and international investors have significant capital targeting commercial real estate and we foresee healthy transaction volumes and steady pricing in 2018. There once again were numerous significant asset transactions in our markets this past quarter."
1,"In the quarter, inventories were approximately $270 million compared to $263 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year, which was in line with our expectations. Looking ahead to 2018, our outlook generally assumes continued stable demand from our pharmaceutical and industrial end markets, consistent growth in our recurring revenue, and balanced growth rates from our geographies. These dynamics lead up to a mid-single-digit constant currency sales increase in 2018."
1,"In total, 2017 favorable reserve development continued to be spread over most of our major lines of businesses and over several accident years, including 43% for accident year 2016, 8% for accident year 2015, 19% for accident year 2014, and 30% for 2013 and prior accident years. Regarding capital management, our approach in financial strength remained stable. We continue to have excellent financial flexibility, including year-end holding company cash and marketable securities that rose 18% from a year ago."
1,"Indonesia's Data-savvy customers continue to respond well to our improved network, as smartphone subscribers now stand at 72% of our subscriber base, which continues to be materially higher than the industry offering. Our customer numbers also continue to grow in a sustainable fashion, as we have added another 1 million customers this quarter, taking our overall base to above 53 million customers, while ARPU has been stable. Ex-Java has been another key growth record for us this year."
1,"Inevitably, we will see mainstream products contributing more to our revenue. With our ROG product line, it's still quite stable but we're seeing greater growth from the mass market product. Seeing this situation, we have two different theories, ROG versus ASUS gaming."
1,"International input was down 7% on a like-for-like basis, mainly due to market weakness and pricing concessions in the Middle East. In absolute terms, divisional input was relatively stable from quarter two to quarter four, reflecting the rig count over that period. Revenues increased 67%, in line with orders, with North America up 78%."
1,"Is it somewhere towards the end? Well, that is why by way of our main target, we keep being able to pay at least 75% from the free cash flow, but at the same time we would like to make our dividend policy more stable and predictable. We see that the volatilities are quite strong and so we will guarantee minimum payment per ordinary share at the level not less than RUB 5 per share, which should support our market in case of some significant instabilities."
1,"It brings incremental diversification and allows us to support our Southern California footprint. Our Consumer Banking segment deliver stable funding and a growing base of customers. On slide 8, I want to talk about technology and innovation, and how we really approach this on two fronts."
1,"It got as high as low 20s with some of the summer initiatives, then came back down to end the quarter at 18% in September. For the fourth quarter, that penetration rate has remained very stable around 18%. Again, as we make further progress on the initiatives that we've discussed, we do expect to make a good progress on that penetration rate."
1,"It is important to note that the 2018 CapEx plans are still more than 40% below the spending peak in 2013. Our company's major CapEx appears relatively steady, but this disguises significant local variations depending on local energy policies and choices. We're seeing significant growth in CapEx on renewables and new energy infrastructure, offsetting declines in coal."
1,"It just depends on the country and the products. But in general on pricing, our prices are very stable. If you looked at tissue in the quarter, we had a 16% increase in cardiac units and a 16% increase in revenue."
1,"It seems like your NPLs got a little bit worse sequentially, and it wasn't   it was pretty much across the board. Your guidance for 2018 is for a stable cost of risk. What should we see   expect for the path of NPLs going forward, given that the economy is reacting, is this just a blip in the radar, or is it a cycle, how should we think about this?"
1,"It started off at a higher number and it will trip down. It's a question of does it trip down enough for us to maintain our guidance and that ones, that is so highly dependent on number of enrollees as well as claims, Richard, it's too early for us to predict either way whether or not that's going to be a hit or stable as we go forward or frankly could receive some savings, so it's just too early. Now I think the second part of your question is regarding the cash benefit from the new tax law."
1,"It was estimated 200,000 to 300,000 cars were lost there. As we look at our coastal performance, it appears things are pretty steady and kind of at the upper 16 million, low 17 million unit range. And we think that some of that is a function of the fact that those are high state income tax locations that might be affected."
1,"It will require revenue growth. I think if we keep our gross margins stable, we will see significant leverage in our cost structure, in our SG&A to reach that level of EBITDA margins."
1,"It'd be lovely if there is some conservatism in the numbers, but it is our best central estimate at the moment. We haven't been through, what I'd call, a stable claims environment and it's been working in our favor in terms of the favorable variations we've been seeing in claims, but that does have an impact on how we think about forecasting it. So we are continuing to forecast a low inflation environment, but there's certainly a claims impact in there."
1,It's a good quarter for Schibsted. We continue on our steady course. But I think we'll just open up for questions.
1,"It's a really good business in terms of leveling out revenues and profitability, which is one of our key tenets. What we strive for is to provide for our shareholders long-term stable growing, less volatile returns. That's what we try to do."
1,"It's Andreas from Exane BNP Paribas. On your comments on margins, I remember in Q3, you said that margins are stable across the board and now you say that you see margin pressure in all business areas. So, something must have changed quite significantly in the quarter."
1,"It's hard to manage the loggers and haulers when you're plus 10%, minus 10% year-over-year. We kind of like our volumes to be relatively steady year-to-year. And we have a long-term harvest plan."
1,"It's how we're fanatically obsessed about productivity, which results in profitability and cash generation. Going through 12 months of steady growth and steady growth, our improvement process is not limited to what we make on machines; it's how we manage our suppliers. And what we've done   I think the team has done an excellent job   is manage that pressure coming into the supply base really well."
1,"It's not a problem. As we have said in the past, we believe that our organic revenue growth is going to be mid-single digits, and I think that   I think once we have this thing at steady state, we would think that that's still our target would be mid-single digits. Steve, I don't know if you have a comment on that."
1,"It's not only the price that you charge, but it's the cost that you pay. And our returns on invested capital over the last couple of years have been pretty stable and second best in the industry. And if I can keep the pricing there and reduce our cost, I think everybody would be really happy."
1,"It's not significant. I mean I think, I did mention that the cash cost is   so, our costs are pretty steady throughout the year. So, when you divide it by the copper price, I mentioned that our cash cost is expected to be $1."
1,"It's really your conversion cost and we've addressed that. So, I would argue our business is more stable this year and going forward than it was last year."
1,"Jeff will provide much more color later in the call. Lastly, our overall occupancy has remained fairly steady over the last six quarters. We believe that this is just the beginning of a long-term positive trend across all markets."
1,"Joe's, the third largest health system in the nation; and Memorial Hermann, the largest not-for-profit health system in Houston and Southeast Texas. The stable nature of our MOB portfolio assets has resulted in average occupancy and same-store cash NOI growth of 92% and 2. 5% percent, respectively, over the last five years."
1,"Just a couple of questions on net interest income, please. So your guidance for next year talks about stable H1 with H2 increase. However, we've seen Q4 already showing stable spreads."
1,"Just a couple. First, if I listened to what you said about how you're handling component shortages and the timing of working through that it would suggest that you probably got more room in the second half of the year than the first half of the year to just start to give some of that pricing back to your customers, is that   obviously, you've talked about your pricing assumption being steady over the course of the year, but is that a fair conclusion?"
1,"Just I'll pick out a couple there because you note originations went from a little over $1 billion to just a little under $1 billion, so a little decline. Our vet business, which is the business we've been in the longest, that business is just   it's stable but it's not growing. We probably had a slight step back just because you reach a point in a market and in a specific industry where you sort of reached or not reached your saturation point, but you've reached a optimal level of origination there."
1,"Just one question is on margins and free cash. I mean, you guys have historically been pretty steady with your margin plans to reinvest in a business and maintain them. Just curious, thoughts, high level again, just given the growth."
1,"Just remaining for me is an idea of how 2018's fee-based business might unfold. Picking up on this comment you made about the DUCs and conversions and completion crews in the second half, does that mean on your properties a significant amount of that guidance is baked into the second half versus the first, or is it pretty even through the year or a steady ramp through the year as you show for basin production?"
1,"Just to go back and connect it to your first question, video was one of the fastest-growing areas of engagement and revenue for us and so just like our excelerate digital agency services. And so, we're putting our resources and our focus into those fast-growing areas and we're seeing   we've seen steady and significant growth in video and programmatic and excelerate and branded content and other categories throughout 2017. We're seeing that growth continue in 2018."
1,"Just to kind of go back a little bit to the -- to M&A. I understand that the multiples have been steady with past, past deals, but are you seeing any pushback from prospective targets as your strategy becomes more well-known in a marketplace which appears to be like a very strong kind of environment right now?"
1,"Just two questions for me. The first one is   again, I understand what   like in all these, the tenants that are in transition, the negative impact it's having on your numbers but if I just kind of think about the rest of your tenant base as you mentioned, the stable tenants, what's going on with them at this point? I mean are you   they also   are you also having to give concessions to them, are you seeing pressure on rents when the leases are expiring?"
1,"K. So UK holds roughly where we are, remains stable, then of course that's a big bonus for us. But underlying for as long as the economies are good, we're always more likely to want to be aggressive in our investment and hold things back."
1,"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your patience and thank you for dialing on during busy seasons period. We hope to continue with our robust performance and come back to you with a steady set of numbers going forward. Thank you for your participation, questions and the interest shown in Minda Corporation."
1,"last year with the malls breaking down and with retail suffering and retail, let's say, shares coming down is leading the way, and we are benefiting from this trend certainly. Other than that, as Breiter also asked before, the demand in banknote printing seems to be just stable, and we are benefiting from our, let's say, market position just as much as from our endeavors to increase our market share. Yeah."
1,"Lastly, I'd like to discuss our long-term portfolio objectives. Our goal is to create a diverse portfolio of investments that generates a stable source of income for our investors. We look to lend in well-structured, appropriately priced opportunities."
1,"Let me just comment on a few of the specific things that   and that goes through any cycle by the way. And if you look at our free cash flow trends, they actually have been pretty steady during the cycles, which actually goes to show the stability and the strength of the business model to begin with. But let me comment on a few of the things you mentioned."
1,"Let me just say, we have   what we say in our model is when we first launch a population. It takes   and it's a little bit quicker with depression and anxiety than it is substance use disorder, but in our model, it calls for in the first year, to take 12 months to ramp up to that steady enrollment rate of 20%. What we're seeing as well is that in year two, we improve upon the 20% to as high as 25%."
1,"Let's comment now on the P&L and specifically on our rental growth performance. After a really steady rental level in 2015 and 2016, rental growth is accelerating and coming back in our P&L with plus 2% for 2017. Occupancy has continued to increase on our office portfolio, specifically in Italy, with an improvement of 400 bps on our Milan office portfolio."
1,Let's go to slide 35. NPEs in Commercial Banking Italy were stable for the first time since the carve-out of Non Core despite the usual fourth Q seasonality. The gross NPE ratio declined to 6.
1,"Let's look at our techfin services. Financell, our consumer finance company continued its steady growth in Q4. The consumer loan portfolio under Financell has reached TRY 4."
1,"Let's move on to slide 29 and talk about our development effort. We accelerated our new restaurant openings to 691 stores, reaching almost 8,000 stores across the country and we maintain a steady pace of new builds across city tiers. KFC has a relatively deeper penetration in lower tier cities."
1,"Let's start with the financial summary on slide 4 of the presentation. As Greg mentioned, during the quarter, our underlying NIM expansion, continued focus on disciplined expense control, stable credit quality and efficient capital management, reflected our commitment to driving improved financial performance and shareholder returns. Reported results were significantly impacted by the items noted on page 1 of our release, including a number of items primarily resulting from the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act."
1,"Let's turn to the cable business. On the cable TV business, our basic TV subscriber base at the end of the fourth quarter last year stayed stable from last year, suggesting improving industry dynamics. The fast ramp-up of digital set-top box penetration led to a strong 13% Y-o-Y rise in DTV subscriber number."
1,"Like the fourth quarter the largest contributor to the revenue results of our Benefits and Insurance group came from declines in a number of our national transactional businesses. While still slightly negative, the full year organic revenue results for our Benefits and Insurance group improved by 200 basis points in 2017 over 2016, and we believe that the investments that we are making in hiring, training and developing our new producers within that group will result in a steady improvement in organic revenue growth in the future. Turning to acquisitions, we're pleased to have closed four strategic acquisitions during 2017 that are expected to add approximately $25 million in annualized revenue."
1,"Loan growth was in line with our expectation at 0. 8%, credit quality was stable, and our book value increased by 6. 9% from a year earlier."
1,"Log sales volumes were comparable to third quarter as stronger takeaway was offset by timing of shipments. In China, demand for our logs remains steady and pricing is strengthening as customers competed against strong demand from U. S."
1,"Longer-term it should increase. The reason that it's been somewhat steady, as you alluded to, is that we had a major customer, our biggest customer in fact, that was ramping very strongly in 2016, and that is making the comparison somewhat tougher. So that is basically what is happening."
1,"Look, thank you, all, very much for joining. We look forward to updating you each quarter on our progress as we stay focused on our three core objectives, capital preservation at the top of the list, delivering a competitive and stable dividend; number two, and importantly, being a best-in-class BDC that's well aligned with our shareholders. I hope you all have a great rest of the day and we look forward to staying in close touch."
1,"Look, there are sponsors, even smaller companies that say we want the assurance that we're going to be on a platform that is going to take us through Phase III and beyond and that's going to stand up to regulatory scrutiny, because if you look at   one of the things we don't talk a lot about is   but if you look at all the data privacy issues, the security issues, the uptime issues, you're going to pay for some of that. And we are far and away the most stable platform, and the one that spends a lot of money making sure that we meet all the requirements our customers have. And so, yeah, there's some part of the market we're probably not going to address, but trust us, we are competitors and we're being aggressive in Phase I as well."
1,"Look, we've talked about pricing in previous investor calls. Our pricing is stable and slightly ticking up over time and we'll be talking about that a little bit more at our half year results on the 21st of February."
1,"Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by over $4 billion primarily through our direct deposit program."
1,"Looking at provision quickly and credits, credit remains really benign and we still believe the outlook to be positive. You can see that our key asset quality measures remain relatively stable over the last year. Fourth quarter results included a $1 million provision for loan loss."
1,"Looking at the divisions, the overall performance of the division, all four sub-divisions were strong. The results were supported by competitive vehicle pricing, a gain in market share, strong improvement in our RSA entry level and smaller SUV sales and stable interest rates, which improved affordability, and the acquisitions of Pentagon and SWT. Excluding the businesses held for sale, Motus achieved revenue and operating profit increases of 18% and 4%, respectively."
1,"Looking forward to 2018, even though we expect some headwinds related to rising interest rates, we remain optimistic about our future and growth prospects. Our core business remains stable and we believe our dividend is supported by a predictable operational cash flows and remains well within our guided payout ratio of 75% to 80% of AFFO. We have issued our initial financial guidance for the year which should provide assurance for the sustainability of our current dividend payout despite the expected interest rate headwind."
1,"Looking forward, this morning, we announced our 2018 capital investment plans for both MPC and MPLX. This plan remains focused on strengthening the sustained earnings power of the business through growth and margin-enhancing projects, as well as expanding our more stable cash flow businesses, especially Speedway and MPLX. Our capital plan for MPC for 2018, excluding MPLX, is $1."
1,"Low volatility weighed on our rates and FX businesses. Credit results exhibited stability against a favorable backdrop for risk assets, and our lending businesses continued to be a source of stable revenues. In 2015, we made the decision to resize and reshape the business because we believed the size of the wallet would not change materially for the next several years."
1,"lumber facilities. In 2015, our power plants came on stream and our EBITDA now includes the stable and predictable contribution from our CAD 100 million-plus fixed asset investment in renewable power. In 2018, our consolidated EBITDA will include the contribution from our significant investment in lumber in the U."
1,"M. Best has affirmed our A- financial strength and long-term issuer credit ratings and have revised their outlook from stable to positive. And now, I would turn the call over to Steve."
1,"M. Best recognized our capital strength in upward operating trends by affirming our A+ financial strength rating with a stable outlook and raising our issuer credit rating outlook to positive. The key to our consistent results lies with our associates, who continued to deliver outstanding service to our agents and their clients, deepening our relationships with our agents and executing on our strategies for long-term success."
1,"Major growth capital will relate to the manufacturing facility for Quest and the completion of the Force Multiplier aircraft for Provincial, as well as some modest fleet additions at Regional One. We expect, given the growth in our business, both organically and through acquisition, stable maintenance capital reinvestment and a lower tax rate as a result of the tax rates in the various jurisdictions we operate in around the world, and the reductions in U. S."
1,"Many projects are just registered in Maharashtra, and others are now catching up. 99acres saw a recovery of some sorts in Q3 with 54% billing growth, we expect a slow and steady recovery in the real estate market over the next three or four quarters. For now, home loan rate stand at six-year low and buyers opting more for RERA-approved and ready-to-move in projects."
1,"Margins were negatively impacted by higher raw material costs of approximately $1 million. Looking at each market, core sales to the food market increased 8%, primarily due to continued growth in our infant nutrition and premium bottled water business and steady growth in the condiment business. Core sales to the beverage market increased 18%, in part due to strong demand for our range of sport closures for the dynamic bottled water market and also due to an increase in custom tooling sales."
1,"market. With stable cash flow from operations and a strong balance sheet, we continue to be well-positioned to execute on our balanced approach to capital allocation. Don, that concludes my comments."
1,"May I have another question on margins, maybe? You said that your margin in general was more or less stable and the decline in margins we saw was more or less driven by the product mix. On the other hand, you say that clients are price-sensitive."
1,"Maybe less in numbers; like I say, I think a number of folks have paused. But in terms of how we would compare our outlook for the next year to year-and-a-half to the last year or so, I'd say pretty steady."
1,"MELS revenues increased 10% in the fourth quarter to CAD 17 million with the increase coming primarily from soundstage and equipment rental activity, but partly offset by a decrease in post-production revenues. Consolidated EBITDA grew CAD 1 million to CAD 23 million in the fourth quarter, our broadcasting activities reported EBITDA of CAD 16 million, compared to CAD 17 million reported last year, while our magazine recorded stable EBITDA at CAD 2 million. MELS recorded EBITDA of CAD 4 million, an increase of CAD 2 million over last year."
1,"More specifically from our managed and franchised business globally, we expect a combination of unit growth sustaining at 6% to 7% annually coupled with near-term RevPAR growth ranging from 1% to 3% annually to yield 4 percentage points to 6 percentage points of total annual adjusted EBITDA growth. As per our owned and leased portfolio, assuming a stable asset base and assuming the same RevPAR growth of 1% to 3% annually, we're anticipating 1 percentage points to 4 percentage points of total annual adjusted EBITDA growth again excluding the impact of transactions. For both our managed and franchised and our owned and leased businesses, we're assuming that we're able to hold margins flat in an environment of relatively modest RevPAR growth."
1,"More specifically, the core part of Greenbrier quite clearly, we have a very good business in Wheels. We have   it's a steady basic business, it's complementary to the rest of our business. But where the engine for most of our earnings and revenue resides is in Manufacturing, our specialty and design engineering, manufacturing execution is well regarded in the industry; and then secondly, our Commercial and Asset Management businesses."
1,"Most of our common alloy aluminum products are sold to sheet metal fabricators that support a variety of end markets. Demand for common alloy aluminum sheet remained relatively stable in the fourth quarter, with lead times remaining at 8 weeks to 12 weeks. Currently, we are seeing demand strengthen with lead times extending to 12 weeks to 16 weeks."
1,"Moving on, funding debt declined approximately 3% sequentially, reflecting the decline in UPB balances over the quarter and our decision to utilize our cash balance to fund more loans with equity. In Q4, we were pleased to welcome the unit of BlackRock to our funding platform to further diversify our stable of investors. As of year-end, we had over $1 billion of committed funding debt capacity, providing over $320 million of excess funding capacity, with maturities on our credit facilities laddered through 2020."
1,"Moving to safety performance on slide 5, we've continued to work hard in this area. The safety performance in our underlying business is stable. However, our newly acquired businesses remain a challenge and a key focus for us."
1,"Mr. Wei Qing just commended that   so in November and December of 2017, our   the number of our active users of TLBB Mobile remained stable. And this is one of our long time goals to stabilize our user base."
1,"My first question has to do with the dividend policy. Earlier, you explained that your decision to increase the dividend this time was partly reflecting the increased stable core operating cash flow. In the Medium-Term Management Plan, the stable core operating cash flow was assumed to be around Â¥400 billion."
1,"My observation is that underwriting standards continue to hold up. Part of the reason that we haven't seen a lot of M&A in upstate New York over the last 10 years is the fact that the market has generally been pretty conservative from an underwriting perspective because the economy doesn't have the tendency to have boom-bust cycles, significant growth followed by curtailment growth, our bank   the approach of the banking industry has been relatively conservative and grounded in reality of slow to moderate growth and stable underwriting approach."
1,"New agent recruiting in the PMA worksite channel contributed to an overall increase of 1% in the average producing agent count. For Colonial Penn, total collected premiums were up 3% in the fourth quarter and 4% for the full year, driven by growth in the block and stable persistency. NAP was up slightly in the quarter, due to opportunistic advertising investment and increased sales productivity."
1,"New customer wins included a major North American energy company optimizing network topology to enable digital and IoT; and a global industrial manufacturing company adopting multi-cloud to scale its business. And across our verticals, our channel program continues to drive a consistent and steady stream of bookings and new customers, with 19% of bookings originating from the channel this quarter, up from 15% last year. The channel is now driving over 40% of new logos and these customers continue to exhibit strong land and expand dynamics."
1,"New products and services we are introducing can produce more opportunities to help patients as well as more opportunity to increase busy clinician productivity as well as our own sales productivity. In addition, we are seeing the steady adoption of our new RD Sensor Line which is a win, win, win for patients, our customers, and us. We currently had a fraction of our customers using RD sensors leaving good potential ahead for further adoption and associated margin improvement."
1,"Next, even in the throes of portfolio simplification, supply chain rationalization and customer consolidation, we continue to benefit from growing consumer demand for customer brands vis-Ã -vis the offerings of global CPG leaders. Much of this competitive advantage stems from our extensive shelf-stable portfolio and its evolution to meet millennial preferences for greater product and authenticity and lifestyle relevance. The effects of this shift in consumption patterns are most evident throughout TreeHouse in our single-serve beverage, carton broth, filled pretzel, and specialty tea categories, along with our regional, specialty, value and Internet channels."
1,"Next, please. As you can see on this slide, our investment strategy has been stable throughout the year with a slight reduction in fixed income assets mainly reinvesting in equity and mutual funds, but also in alternative assets. We took advantage of higher volatility of the year to make changes in our portfolio."
1,"NextSeq continues to perform well, and the system and associated consumables remain a very important growth driver for Illumina, as customers use the system for a broad set of research, translational and clinical applications. Rounding out our benchtop systems, we continued to see stable win rates and solid adoption by new-to-sequencing customers who represented approximately 60% of MiniSeq and MiSeq shipments in the fourth quarter. We look forward to shipping the first commercial units of our latest desktop system, the iSeq, towards the end of the first quarter."
1,"No, I think the   as you said, we have a stable performance, a good performance in most of our production units and so forth, and also good product mix. But the margin should have been higher if we would have had stable prices in pulp..."
1,"No, that's fine and helpful. What have we been talking about all in 2017 as we've done our refocus is, look, we really feel like we've got good steady, strong revenue growth in Travel Network and Hospitality Solutions. We had issues to deal with in Airline Solutions."
1,"Note that we have adjusted our selling prices by an average of 23% to offset this excise tax. Total input material cost this year has been estimated to be more stable compared to last year with some like sugar, non-dairy creamer, Robusta trending downwards while wheat flour, palm oil, potato flakes, and packaging will actually trend higher. But forex and inflation will continue to remain a threat to profitability."
1,"Now our future performance is going to be driven by growing the restaurant base to 1,900 restaurants through traditional and non-traditional formats. Growing average unit volumes at a 3% five-year CAGR through our menu innovation and value, break through advertising and growing new platforms like IHOP'N Go and Delivery, and running great newly remodeled restaurants with guest-facing technology in a stable and engaged franchisee community. We expect to deliver a 4% system-wide revenue CAGR and over 200 basis points of margin expansion from 45% to 47% over time."
1,"Now the difference between that paid trend or what you might call an allowed trend, the allowed trend would also include the effect of costs borne by the individual customer in terms of deductibles and co-pays, et cetera. Given that we tend to have high customer retention from period to period and our clients have pretty stable benefits from period to period, we haven't seen much difference between paid or allowed trends. But if you look at that allowed basis, that includes the effect of cost sharing and such."
1,"Now turning to results, I'll compare results from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the third quarter of 2017. Our performance in the fourth quarter demonstrated continued execution of our financial strategy of delivering stable and growing cash flows, consistent distribution growth and maintaining financial flexibility. For the fourth quarter, consolidated net income was $77 million, which is unchanged compared to the third quarter."
1,"Now, I'd like to turn to our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2018. Our 2018 outlook reflects continued strong growth in each of our businesses, stable credit, a sustained higher mix of new customers and originations and no significant impact to our businesses from regulatory changes. Any significant volatility in the British pound from current levels could impact our results."
1,"Now, please turn to slide number 19. This slide summarizes the five-year trends of 2013 to 2017 for net profits and the cash flow, although the fluctuations in our EBITDA numbers have been relatively high, the reported net profit has had a stable positive development. The compounded annual growth rate since 2013 has been 5."
1,"Now, turning to Basel IV and the impact on our RWAs. As Kees mentioned earlier, we estimate that the impact of Basel IV on our RWA based on a steady balance sheet and without taking into account mitigation actions, we estimate RWA to increase by around 35%. The biggest impact is on credit risk and our corporate loans and mortgages."
1,"Now, we sacrificed a little yield for that which we did in the fourth quarter on originations, but we expect that to bounce back as we start getting towards the spring months. So our overall view is that the competitive market remains pretty steady and hasn't really dramatically shifted over the last, call it, six months."
1,"Now, we will continue to try to push the margin to the extent we can every year. But for me, steady improvement in margin is definitely in our roadmap for the group."
1,"NPAs were up a bit from 45 to 63 basis points. However, our impaired asset-to-capital ratio remains steady at 20%, and we also enjoyed net recoveries for the quarter. I will now turn the call back to Hadley."
1,"Number one is gradually increasing of capacity coming online for development is enabling us to fulfill requirements from clients in terms of request for proposal. As I said in my introduction, our request for proposal level has not dropped and our win rate is still very, very stable, we're very happy with our win rate. So, the additional capacity coming online in development is enabling us to keep the pipeline full that is driving one large element of the success."
1,"number one, expansion of our core technology product platforms in the form of EpiFix and AmnioFix; number two, product introductions of our umbilical cord product, EpiCord and AmnioCord and our placental tissue product, AmnioFill, for bridging compromised integumentary tissue; and number three is the steady expansion of AmnioFix Injectable in musculoskeletal pain applications. We expect to see continued market expansion and market share gains in the wound care space."
1,"Obviously, a couple of company-specific factors are sort of driving the recent trend there. I'm sorry if I missed this early in the call, but can you give us any color in terms of your thoughts on the underlying market growth, are we still seeing sort of flattish but stable trends there? Any updated thoughts on sort of what might be driving the sustained weakness that we've been seeing there?"
1,"Obviously, Air Fresheners will not grow as quickly in rural, so we're seeing some growth there. But so Hair Colours, Insecticides, these are all products, some of them are stable, some of them are little bit less, little bit more discretionary. But across the broad, I think, once you see a pickup in rural demand, it should start providing a meaningful uptick to most of the portfolio, apart from Air Fresheners and perhaps Liquid Detergents."
1,"Obviously, I can see the slide laying out your parameters and so on. I was just wondering how important is it for you and for the board to have a stable or progressive dividend especially in years where the salmon prices and therefore your earnings will be volatile?"
1,"Obviously, lower ticket sized projects continued to do better than the projects which are greater than INR 1 crore in most markets, expect Mumbai, where I would take the reference is greater than INR 2 crores. On the approval fronts, we made steady progress on the approvals and for our Pune project, in fact, we have all of the approvals in place, from a launch perspective, except the environment clearances, without which, we can't get the Commencement Certificate, without which, we can't do the RERA registration. And the environment clearance has been held up because of the shift from the State Environment Impact Authority to the Environment Cell of the Building Plan Department and again, back now to the Environment Impact Authority."
1,"Obviously, payroll taxes impact that in the first quarter. But our expectations for stable gross margins in Flex margins, I would say, specifically is where we had been for quite some time. And we continue to think about leverage and productivity as the key, as Joe had specifically mentioned, to driving the operating margin target, still feel very confident that we're going to meet those."
1,"Obviously, there is a little bit of a dip in the fourth quarter, and I think speeds are generally down in January as well. And now, with the spike we've had in interest rates, can you guys share your outlook on whether or not you think there's potential for speeds to incrementally decline again in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter, or if you think they're going to be more sort of stable from where they were? Thanks."
1,"Obviously, we have inclusion criteria that require the wounds. As you know, we have this monitoring period upfront, so our goal is to try to find stable wounds, not reoccurring wounds to try to eliminate some of the bias of wounds that could be just shrinking and growing on normal RDEB patients according to some natural history data can have both. In the chronic wounds, we think, are just a bit more minimal for clinical analysis, I think, as we can all agree."
1,"Obviously, we made some investments in our lending team; we're also making some investments in space for our senior and executive management team. So, I would expect our efficiency ratios to be relatively stable. The biggest driver for our efficiency ratio, as we've seen, is really our growth in net interest income."
1,"Obviously, you will recognize that Airbus had called out the A400M now which was a headwind I guess we were aware of and was included in our guidance. So we see some pluses and minuses, but our stable outlook for Space & Defense remains as our guidance."
1,"Of course, this stability is the direct result of many changes, all aimed at building complementary franchises in Institutional Securities, Wealth Management, and Investment Management. Importantly, a greater proportion of our earnings are now derived from more stable and higher-ROE businesses. This increased contribution from Wealth Management and Investment Management should help preserve profitability during periods of market disruption."
1,"Of the acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter, 57% were one-off transactions. As to pricing, cap rates remained steady in the fourth quarter. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted-average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 175 basis points in the fourth quarter which were above our historical average spreads."
1,"Okay, sir. Sir, can we assume that steel prices are going up and broadly cement prices are stable, so will we have some arbitration is more in terms of competitive strength in terms of, say, your competitor steel roofing?"
1,"Okay. And just one last one on your pipeline, you characterized it as being pretty steady, pretty forward, would you characterize anything in there as being more than a bolt-on and potentially transformational?"
1,"Okay. And on Fortamet, I just wanted to check the market   if you look at market as a whole   while your market share has been largely stable, but if you look at market as a whole, it continues to lose volumes. Like even for us, volumes in Fortamet according to IMS declined 15% sequentially, what's happening here?"
1,"Okay. And then, just on the reserve coverage, relatively stable at 96 basis points, but I think you've spoken in the past, given the source of loan growth and the coverage you provide on residential mortgage, that that coverage ratio should still come down. Could you just remind us kind of what you're providing on a new single-family resi mortgage in CRE and C&I?"
1,"Okay. Atlanta, because the well is already drilled and we are ready to startup, our expectation is that once we start and open the first well, it should take us approximately 7 days or 10 days to have a stable scenario in all the production properties. In other words, having all the vessels filled, our components adjusted, all the control regulated to the process and once everything is stable, then we'll be opening the well fully."
1,"Okay. San Dimas, have   has that mine had a steady growth in reserves and resources, or what has that looked like in the last couple of years?"
1,"Oliver Steel, Deutsche Bank. The sort of obvious question but quite broad which is, I wonder if you can just put a little bit more detail around your guidance towards a stable combined ratio over the next 12 months. Some of your competitors are talking about sort of increased pricing competition, so perhaps   as I say, can you talk through what's happening on pricing, what that implies for the loss ratio, and also how the expense ratio comes into that assumption as well?"
1,"On slide 17, we've highlighted our Canadian credit card and unsecured personal lending portfolios. The late-stage delinquency rate of our Canadian unsecured personal lending portfolio continues to remain stable. Looking at our Canadian cards portfolio, there were two main factors driving the quarterly increase."
1,"On slide 22, you will see our outlook. Looking to the first quarter, we expect total loans to be up 1% to 3% annualized linked-quarter; net charge-offs to be in the range of 35 basis points to 45 basis points, assuming no unexpected deterioration in the economy; and the loan loss provision to match net charge-offs plus loan growth; GAAP margin to be down 1 basis point to 3 basis points with core margin stable compared to fourth quarter due to the adjustment on tax exempt assets from the new corporate tax rate change; fee income to be up 1% to 3% versus like quarter; expenses to be flat versus like quarter excluding merger-related and restructuring charges and other onetime items; and our effective tax rate of about 21%. Looking ahead to the full year, we expect to grow loans in the 2% to 4% range, which should be stronger than the 2% from 2017; taxable-equivalent revenues up 2% to 4%; and expenses flat excluding merger related and restructuring charges and other onetime items; and an effective tax rate of about 21%."
1,"On slide 5, you can see our AUM progression for the quarter and full year along with a breakdown by Affiliate and asset class. Here, you can see that our participation in many of the faster-growing, higher-fee segments of the marketplace has been the primary driver behind the steady growth in our asset base. More than 50% of our AUM is in global, international, and emerging markets equity strategies, with another 9% in alternative investments."
1,"On the commercial side, new loan opportunities are up 28% compared with last year. Our strategy of building our core loan portfolio, which we define as loan relationships under $10 million in size, continues to help provide steady sustainable organic growth. For 2017, new commitments under $10 million accounted for 47% of the total volume for the full year."
1,"On the macro machining business which has been predominantly our fiber lasers for Amada, we introduced our Gen 3 product. It is now very stable and running very solidly in our factory and within Amada. Now we're trying to catch up with the demand."
1,"On the maintenance side, the churn rates   so we actually quote it the other way. We're talking about what the renewal rate is, and our renewal rates have stayed steady, even in an environment where we've announced maintenance to subscription plan and raised price 5% on maintenance in the first year and given visibility that maintenance price mid-year this year goes up 10%, mid-year next year goes up 20%, and we've seen a huge uptick of people converting. And as they convert, you get the example like when we talked about in the earning call."
1,"On the right-hand side of the slide you can see the breakdown between group provisions and specific provisions, which tends to be less predictable. You can see that our group provisions have been stable at the range of ILS 140 million to ILS 155 million since the third quarter of 2016, and are down to ILS 88 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. We remain confident in our underwriting monitoring and collection capabilities as we continue growing our book."
1,"On this slide, we've set out the components of our funding profile. You can see here an increase in the proportion of customer deposits within our overall funding profile, which has remained very stable over the last several years, and the reduction in our loan-to-deposit ratio to 80%. We've also improved the maturity profile of our wholesale funding, reducing reliance on less than one year funding, which now represents some 36% of total wholesale funding, down from 44% in December 2013."
1,"On this year, we expect that similar range. We're not going to give the outlook any more on the compliance spending because it's become more stable now, and it's part of our normal business but I don't expect it to change materially this year."
1,"On top of all this, our base business is performing very well with compelling new opportunities in advertising, thanks to more and more data that we have to sell. And we have a growing number of reliable and steady revenue sources, including retrans and reverse comp, and domestic and international multiplatform content licensing. So you can see why we feel extremely confident in our ability to drive earnings for years to come and why we look forward to continuing to update you on our progress."
1,"On top of that, though, I think you did see a very nice amount of margin expansion in Q4 specifically, and I think that is indicative of the fact that we are continuing to find additional efficiency opportunities. And it's a steady journey in this company; I wouldn't say it's one and done. And so I would expect that to be a contributing factor as well to 2018's anticipated margin guidance."
1,"Once the first two trains are on line, the potential for peak delivery and scalability of Prosperidade is phenomenal. The long-term outlook for Area 1 is expected to deliver stable production volumes, more than 1 billion barrels of net recoverable resource and superior free cash flow. We're excited about the value a project of this scale brings to Anadarko's portfolio."
1,"One basis point for the year net charge-offs. Kind of hard to project that, but as we look at the horizon and kind of see the visibility we have today, we think our asset quality's -- will continue to remain pretty strong and stable. The tax rate."
1,"One more for me going back to your guidance. Just so I understand your commentary, I know you're looking at sort of a   call it, 200 basis point, even 500 basis point pick up in occupancy, but it sounds like the vast majority of that is going to recur certainly late in the year as opposed to sort of seeing more of a steady pick up throughout the year. Is that fair to assume?"
1,"One of the challenges with alternative managers has been inconsistent distributions and this has been driven by the core difference between cash distributions and dividends that Mike McFerran will explain in a minute. So therefore, we're electing to move to a steady quarterly dividend that will be based on our after-tax fee related earnings and this dividend will be reassessed each year based upon the level and growth of our after-tax FRE. We believe this has two obvious benefits."
1,"One of the key factors for the revenue growth was the ongoing production on one of our larger defense programs. We work closely with our customer during the first quarter to troubleshoot and resolve certain technical issues associated with the integration of our product into the end user's assembly and was able to increase production to a stable run rate by the end of the second quarter, which continued for the balance of the year. Gross margin for Sypris Electronics improved to 9."
1,"One positive note with UMS is they have some strong partners as well and we think that will be additive over time. So, I would look and certainly with UMS, you're going to see our international business grow and get more to steady state growth. But right now, 36% year-over-year, which maintains about 10% of our total revenue."
1,"one, strong growth in net interest income due to healthy balance sheet growth and higher yields from our investment securities portfolio; two, strong client funds balance growth; three, higher core fee income driven primarily by foreign exchange transaction volumes and higher total client fund balances; four, stable credit with solid underlying trends; five, somewhat higher expenses related to incentives tied to our strong performance; and six, continued strong levels of capital and liquidity with some slower growth and on balance sheet deposits. As Greg indicated, these results were partially offset by certain items related to tax reform, including a $37."
1,"Operating expenses were higher as we continue to invest in our strategic development as well as faced rising regulatory compliance and control cost and inflationary pressures. The cost to income ratio was broadly stable at 51% and within our 2018 target range. We have ambitious plans to continue to improve our service to our customers whether that is through better processes, greater use of technology, getting better at the basics or just by working together in a more collaborative way."
1,"operational improvement of 180 basis point, mainly due to some of our project moving to steady state from transition phase; absence of one-time people restructuring costs of 90 basis points; SG&A leverage of 130 bps; and absence of buyback cost of 20 basis points. For the quarter, we have a forex loss of $1."
1,"operations   the European operations go, we are very pleased with how the partnership, with Air France-KLM is evolving and we're starting to see better quality of passengers as well as the network effects kicking in on the European operations. The UK operations is witnessing the stabilization of the new Mumbai-London flight that we added and our Asian markets are fairly stable, I'm not seeing a big movement either way and our SAARC operations are primarily feeder markets for the Gulf and the European sectors. So overall, I see a stable RASK year-over-year and I'm talking about international here, okay."
1,"Opus' cost of deposits was flat for the prior quarter at 45 basis points and has remained relatively flat over the past eight quarters since the Fed began its current rising rate campaign in December 2015. While we have experienced runoff in deposits over the past year, both intentional and unintentional, the diversity of Opus' sources of deposits has remained stable and consistent. Transaction accounts comprise 94% of total deposits and demand deposits comprise 55%."
1,"Organic growth for the base business is expected to be at 4% to 5% and as Rob mentioned, the impact of EUROIMMUN adding just north of 100 basis points. Our organic revenue growth guidance assumes 9% organic revenue growth in Diagnostics and 4% revenue growth in DAS, driven by a stable pharma biotech, improved academic and industrial, with food and environmental end markets accelerating on strong 2017 comparisons. Geographically, we expect mid single-digit organic revenue growth in the Americas and Europe with mid to high single-digit organic revenue growth in Asia."
1,"Organic improved by 90 bps at constant rates, driven by margin accretion in Products and also by the benefit of the stronger portfolio mix which contributed 30 basis points. Our disciplined focus on cost and capacity management also resulted in stable Resources margin despite a revenue decline of 8. 6%."
1,Our 2018 outlook does not yet capture the impacts from the Nextel acquisition. Our revenue in 2018 is expected to remain stable versus 2017 on a rebased basis as higher cable subscription revenue and higher contribution from our B2B business and MVNO-related partnerships will be offset by continued regulatory and competitive headwinds. We anticipate a solid 7% to 8% rebased adjusted EBITDA growth for 2018 driven by lower Full MVNO-related costs driven by the accelerated onboarding of our Full MVNO customers to our own network and a continued focus on our overhead expenses and indirect spend resulting in a further margin expansion.
1,"Our Advanced Materials business reported EBITDA of $53 million. This business is focused on growing its core specialty businesses, and as specialty volumes increased 4% in the quarter, EBITDA margins remained steady at 25% in our specialty business and 21% overall. The volume improvement was across all of our specialty markets."
1,"Our asset liability sensitivity is still pretty neutral. And so, I anticipate our margin to stay fairly stable. Some of that will depend on what David referenced earlier, depending on how competition for loan pricing is that would impact our margin right along with competition on deposit pricing."
1,"Our assumption is that price remains relatively stable over the course of the year versus what we've been experiencing post the price increase in 2017. And so, the only impact you have from price, as I've just mentioned, context of the overall market would be the slight benefit or tailwind to our results in the first quarter."
1,"Our assumptions for 2018 are included in the guidance we are providing today. In terms of the generic industry and our positioning, we will always work to be a stable source of high-quality product that our trade partners have come to know and rely on over the years. However, when it no longer makes sense in terms of profitability, we have to make tough decision as to whether we will continue to offer a product or consider discontinuing it, as we have done with certain commoditized drugs."
1,"Our businesses are simply doing well. Our dividend-paying capacity is strong, and we assume a stable growing dividend going forward. At the same time, when taking into account the already high level of operating result in 2017, which is partially driven by exceptional favorable operating conditions in 2017, and the low amount of large claims in Q1, the uncertain developments in today's financial markets as a result of which direct investment yields have been reduced, and the â‚¬30 million impact from the January storms, we reckon we have a slightly moderated earnings level in 2018."
1,"Our capital and liquidity positions are very strong, and we comfortably exceed the requirements to be considered well-capitalized by federal banking regulators. A large size of our investment portfolio and our stable deposit base provide ample liquidity to fund growth in our loan portfolio. The investment portfolio also allows us to manage interest rate risk effectively, and our slightly asset-sensitive balance sheet will provide a benefit to earnings if interest rates continue to increase."
1,"Our core net interest margin was very good, we think, in the fourth quarter of 2017. The core margin excludes the impact of additional yield accretion recognized with our updated estimates of the acquired loan pools, that improved about 11 basis points compared to a year ago quarter and was stable compared to the third quarter of this year at 3. 68%."
1,"Our core products were the driver of performance and we saw our revenue increase in every core product group for the quarter. On the industrial side of the business, I'm pleased to report that the steady pace we saw through the first nine months of 2017 continued in the fourth quarter and even strengthened in certain areas. For example, our incoming orders for Portable Gas Detection and Fall Protection increased nearly 15% collectively in the quarter."
1,"Our Corn team has delivered important yield and productivity improvements in lysine, resulting in a turnaround of that business. Oilseeds announced the sale of our Bolivian Oilseeds operations and worked hard to diversify our oil streams into a wider variety of products to help capture steady margins. WFSI continued to deliver sales synergies throughout 2017, with a pipeline of more than 2,000 individual projects."
1,"Our decision to adjust our annual long-term growth rate was based on several factors. First of all, we increased the lower end of the range based on the new lower corporate tax rate and our confidence about delivering steady results in the future. Second, we lowered the top end of the range to more accurately reflect the outperformance from Energy Services that was due to weather, as it did this quarter and will for fiscal 2018."
1,"Our design and product teams are focused on delivering products that allow our customers to move money quickly and safely, real time account information and insights that will allow them to save more money, and thoughtful help and support when they need it. Likewise, our technology teams are making certain that our systems are high performing and stable, our sites and tools are easy to use, and most importantly that they are secure at a time, when we're seeing peak volumes surpass our most aggressive forecasts. That's important, this is stuff, we know that our customers really value."
1,"Our dramatically expanded business and geographical scale has and does allow us to generate impressive year-over-year results as evidenced by our record growth in 2017. We have increasingly stable and predictable performance, and better forward visibility as a result of our more established operations, and we have realized sustained enhancements in returns on equity and expect to generate even greater investment returns in 2018 and beyond. Excluding the impact of one-time charges related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax asset and our homebuilder acquisitions, our adjusted net income was $28."
1,"Our EBITDA has been greater level of infrastructure investment on particularly those largest strategic sites, as you noted before. The profit and loss work in progress recovery has continued to get closer and closer to the cash investment levels as both the shift to larger strategic sites is being completed with the related higher infrastructure burden, and the more significant investment into work in progress as part of the customer journey that Pete highlighted earlier and the knock-on effect on both programs that's added approximately two weeks to delivery is broadly at a steady state. Land cost per plot recovered through the P&L has shown marginal growth over the past five years."
1,"Our fee result is the key driver of this positive development, and it rose by 11% to CHF 442 million. We kept our risk result at a stable level. We defended our risk-rate margin in spite of higher currency hedging costs and low interest rates."
1,"Our funded balance sheet was broadly flat compared to the third quarter of 2017, and remains a little over â‚¬1 trillion. The proportion of total funding from the most stable sources stood at 72%. Slightly more than half of our total funding comes from retail and transaction banking deposits, 14% from our long-term debt and capital markets activities, and a further 6% from equity capital."
1,"Our global presence widened, with new Evercore offices in Asia and the Middle East and our sector team strengthened significantly, especially in general industrials. Our results this year are a testament to the strength of our team and our steady investments in talent, both in recruiting senior talent to the firm and in developing and promoting high-quality senior talent within the firm. 2017 was, again, a strong recruiting year, with the addition of seven senior managing directors and senior advisors in Advisory, with a particular focus on our general industrials practice."
1,"Our goal is clearly stable to improved. But, again, there's a lot of moving pieces here and, as we demonstrated in the fourth quarter, you try to manage it to the optimal level during the quarter."
1,"Our Goderich mine transition is already delivering benefits and is expected to deliver $30 million in run rate savings by the end of 2018, assuming average winter weather demand. Our Plant Nutrition businesses are expected to continue steady growth, and last, our corporate-wide $20 million cost savings plan remains on track. It has delivered $12 million in savings to-date, with the balance expected in 2018."
1,"Our gross profit for our online game segment declined year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter, as the result of decreased revenue contribution from some of our self-developed mobile games. Margins for our online games segment was relatively stable at 61. 4% in the fourth quarter compared to 60."
1,"Our investment strategy remains unchanged and our focus continues to be on network infrastructure, renewable generation, and the drinking water business. Thereby, we will further strengthen our stable and regulated activities in lower Austria which remained the basis of sustainable and stable earnings. All in all, we plan to invest approximately â‚¬400 million in each of the coming financial year."
1,Our liquidity reserves account for well over one-quarter of our total funded balance sheet. Over 70% of our balance sheet is funded from the most stable sources. And our fully loaded CET1 ratio is among the highest in the industry.
1,"Our members have made significant investments in CFC in the form of short-term investments, as well as long-term capital. We view these investments to have limited reinvestment risk, thus providing a stable source funding for CFC. Our member investments stood at $4."
1,Our net charge-off experience is indicative of that economic performance. Our net charge-offs have been relatively stable over the last few years. But the variance generally in line with business mix changes.
1,"Our new teams in expanded markets including greater Boston and New Jersey should contribute to this growth. Our margins are expected to be steady, barring any significant change in deposit betas. Credit shows no sign of deteriorating and we anticipate that it will remain stable throughout the year."
1,"Our operating margins were 37%, and during the quarter, we returned over $50 million to shareholders via share repurchases and dividend. Our core business is strong and stable, and we remain committed to operating efficiently with targeted investments in product and people to further strengthen our core, while also building our capabilities for future growth. As we've discussed, our goal is to drive sustainable long-term shareholder value by building an increasingly stronger business."
1,"Our operating plan also includes investment in the new Workforce Administration bundle, our traditional employment offering. The combination of improved worksite employee growth, stable gross profit and continued investment in operating leverage leads to our forecast of an 11% to 15% increase in adjusted EBITDA from $178 million in 2017 to a range of $197 million to $204 million for 2018. We are forecasting a 21% to 26% increase in adjusted EPS from $2."
1,"Our OTC artificial tears business, which has sales of approximately $500 million globally, is a growing and durable business too. Our glaucoma drops business remained stable in 2017, and we continue to have the majority of the topical market. Our strategy here is to shift the treatment paradigm in the next several years towards dropless therapies with bimatoprost SR along with our XEN implant."
1,"Our outlook would assume that the loan growth would provide the majority of the earning asset growth of the investment portfolio would be relatively stable, and the benefit that we mentioned there is really just the roll-off of the current cash flows being re-priced at today's market rate, so which would be a lift for us."
1,"Our overall approach to building on our robust balance sheet will be guided by our overall capital management framework, which also provides dividend framework with the overarching priority of creating shareholder value. Our first priority is the reinvestment in our high-return capital programs and steady growth strategy over the next three years. Secondly, we are targeting 20% as the net gearing ratio by the end of FY 2019, which means we will ensure enough cash is held over as a notional debt repayment to ensure we meet our debt repayment obligations."
1,"Our paperboard facility has the capacity to produce 180,000 metric tons of lightweight paperboard used in a variety of applications, including greeting cards, lotto tickets and packaging for consumer goods. Our paperboard business is a nice addition to the portfolio with stable demand and opportunities to drive long-term growth. We also have two high-yield pulp facilities, one in Matane and the other in Temiscaming, QuÃ©bec, with a total capacity of 570,000 metric tons."
1,"Our performance in 2017 confirms our strong momentum. Our revenue grew by steady 4% at constant currency with an acceleration in the last quarter, where it reached 6. 2%."
1,"Our pipeline is strong which gives us great optimism for 2018. Turning to the liability side of the balance sheet, deposits remained stable and we had another very good quarter in terms of managing our deposit cost. Our total cost of funds was flat for the quarter at 29 basis points."
1,"Our portfolio is also differentiated by our new mine growth prospects, turning to slide 27. Our pipeline is among the best in the gold sector in terms of depth and the capital efficiency, and it gives us the means to maintain steady production while growing our margins and our reserves. Projects included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here."
1,"Our power converters were used in several microgrid projects in 2017, and those installations are operating well. Microgrid projects tend to be very site-specific with a wide range of electrical loads and generation sources acting together to provide a stable, high quality power for a facility. As a result, these systems typically require significant project engineering, which tends to pace the rate of implementation."
1,"Our pricing performance has been strong all year, as you know, as well as our sales performance, it's been very steady, in terms of market share, in terms of year-over-year sales gains for the entire year. Even in months, as I mentioned when   the report I'm looking at, Chevrolet was over $7,500 in incentives on pickup trucks with their employee discount sale in December."
1,Our quarterly results were driven by a solid blended lease rate growth of 1. 9%; a robust top line contribution from our long-lived operating initiatives; stable occupancy of 96. 8%; annualized turnover that was 40 basis points lower year-over-year; and a continued objective to drive down expense growth where possible.
1,"Our rate of shrinking revenues, if that's the way to put it, has been narrowing every quarter. And I think now we're seeing increases in both billable head count hours and revenues on a week-to-week, month-to-month basis in a pretty steady fashion. So I think if you play those numbers out, we're not giving exact guidance at the Oxford level in terms of revenues, but you can see that we're getting back to a point where hopefully we'll be returning to growth here very soon."
1,"Our sales and business development staff count has increased by 3 to be at 85 now with addition across three verticals. Our attrition has marginally increased to 38% in Q3, which is likely to move to stable levels once the staff redeployment process completes. With this, I will like to hand over the call back for Q&A."
1,"Our solutions get more and more complex. And as a result with each of these upgrade cycles that we see, we have the ability to maintain very stable pricing, very stable gross margins year-in and year-out across all of our product categories because of this increasing complexity of the controller and increasing value that we're providing. Just going over some of the highlights, on the client SSD side, certainly you see that penetration number increasing to upwards 70% over the next three to four years."
1,"our strong loan growth, a stable net interest margin, lower operating expenses and pristine credit quality. First, on the lending front."
1,"Our suite of domestic fixed income ETF had their strongest quarter ever with $179 million of inflows driven by AGGY, which continues to build an impressive performance track record versus passive benchmarks and the most sophisticated active managers. During the fourth quarter, the dollar again was fairly stable and sentiment briefly improved towards Japan. WisdomTree took in $0."
1,"Our supply chain performed well, 95% on-shelf availability of our top 1,000 items was delivered again. CapEx was in line with expectations, and our leverage remained steady at 2. 2 times EBITDA."
1,"Our team remains committed and we continue to implement claims rating and other underwriting actions. Our Life & Health division continues to be a stable source of earnings with strong and predictable cash flows, excluding last year's charge to increase our voluntary outreach efforts; net income increased $2 million in the quarter and $10 million for the year. Our balance sheet and capital levels remain strong with nearly $200 million of cash in investments at the holding company plus borrowings available under the revolving credit agreement from the subsidiaries."
1,"Our total deposits were essentially unchanged from the end of the prior quarter. Another deposit metric that we keep our eye on is our mix of deposits between consumer and business, which remains steady at 53% and 47%, respectively. Our loan-to-deposit ratio remains strong at 76."
1,"Overall delinquencies for most portfolios stayed relatively stable at low levels with cards higher quarter-over-quarter largely due to seasonality. As you can see, our PCL remains largely stable across all Canadian retail products. Slide 19 shows that the credit quality of our Canadian mortgage portfolio continues to be strong with provisions remaining at 2 basis points."
1,"Overall the UK business climate is good and our focus is on operational execution. Outside the UK, our Polish business is stable and ERS has been restructured to a profitable core franchise. In financial terms for the UK/Europe segment we are targeting revenue growth of 21% or 5% same railroad revenue growth excluding currency."
1,"Overall, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, North America accelerated in terms of overall growth. We also had a nice change in trend in our Middle East, Africa and South Asia business, still flattish type growth, but dramatically better than it has been in the last several quarters and Europe was quite stable. Digital continued to grow in the mid-20% range, which continues to be a strong growth opportunity for us."
1,"Overall, I'm pleased with the success that we have achieved over the last year as we consistently delivered our quarterly goal of $5 million in noninterest income. Within that, our customer service fees have grown 49% year-over-year and have become a steady revenue stream for the bank. Additionally, we have good production momentum in SBA and our premium on loans sold in Q4 averaged 11."
1,"Overall, our approach to reinsurance is that where we have more stable risks we retain more, so that as we improve experience we get the upside for ourselves. For new risks whether portfolios are relatively smaller, till they reach a meaningful scale, we prefer reinsuring more."
1,"Overall, our Farm business is positioned for a successful year in 2018. Our business in Brazil continues to make slow, but steady progress. Volume has increased every month since we commissioned the facility in line with our expectation and guidance of launching a start the -up in the new market."
1,"Overall, the fourth quarter operational performance was relatively in line with our outlook highlighted on last quarter's call. In Fluids, revenues pulled back modestly from the prior quarter, while we're seeing steady improvements in drilling activity over the past few months, the fourth quarter started with some softness in both the U. S."
1,"Page 13 is a bit of a slush and a summary of these producing assets obviously Canadian Malartic continues to be our cornerstone asset and has performed this year in terms of what we had expected from it and it continues to be a great asset with evolution not only in terms of production but also in terms of increasing minable reserves. The Eleanor project continue to advance and as we are growing we have sliding scale  here that increases total production has increased so even if steady state our royalty goes up as more ounces are produced and we get further into that. So the guidance for 2018 is looking good but it did produce 305,000 ounces in 2017 and one of the world's top 30 gold mines."
1,"Page 18, the summary. First of all, the consolidated results, although we are making steady progress for the achievement of full-year results for the shareholder return based on the current share prices progress in business results and free cash flow, we have resolved to buy back our shares. Secondly, business strategy."
1,"Performance here reflects timing issues relating to an uptick in policy renewals and premium payments, as well as several new policies financed. Despite tightening margins and heightened competition from a few larger players, our emphasis on experience, longevity and consistency in this business with key advisor partners continues to result in a steady flow of opportunities referred to our team. The tax credit lending business also posted a strong quarter, up $46 million in the period and $91 million or 63% for the year."
1,"Performance Materials revenues were slightly negative as we exited some low-margin commodity lines. With the complex Evansville manufacturing consolidation largely complete, we anticipate steady improvement in our Performance Materials results. Operating income of $8 million for the quarter was $400,000 lower than the year-ago period, for an operating margin of 5."
1,"Peter, with regards to your earlier commentary, I mean, clearly, we were   I think all analysts are anticipating some kind of pickup in business with the launch of the payloads with modest ramps this year. Given your commentary that you expect this to be a bit slower than expected, can you provide any clarity with regards to where you might see any growth opportunities this year or should we expect current revenues to be more of a steady state run rate for this year until the full constellation is really up and running?"
1,"Phil will have more to say about investment income, book value, the CATs and prior-period development. On our third quarter call, I reported that we began to see signs of a bit more stable pricing environment for the business we wrote. In the fourth quarter, that positive rate movement continued and, in fact, accelerated month-by-month as the quarter progressed, with prices beginning to firm in a number of important classes, both property and casualty related, and that trend has continued into January."
1,"Potential headwinds include elevated new supply and higher interest rates at both ends of the curve. Taken together, these macro drivers should result in a relatively stable 2018 apartment environment, with our portfolio pricing power and occupancy expected to be similar to that of 2017. Beyond 2018, we are more optimistic on a macro outlook for our business, as global and U."
1,"Pre-tax income from our fixed income portfolio was $453 million this quarter, consistent with the prior three quarters of 2017, but lower than the $469 million in the prior year quarter. Our limited partnership portfolio had a steady quarter producing $50 million of pre-tax income, a 2. 2% return compared with $58 million of pre-tax income in the prior year quarter."
1,"Pretty special. No doubt, many of you know that in May of this year Altria's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Marty Barrington is retiring, and of course, all of us who've come to CAGNY for many years also know how important and steady a presence Altria has been at the conference over the years. So, it is a true pleasure today to say a few words about Marty on behalf of all of us in the CAGNY community as we induct him into our own very own hall of fame."
1,"Prices are up, but to our costs we saw a little bit of spread improvement towards the back end of Q4, but not really impacting Q1 results. So our spot spreads were actually stable into Q1. In terms of ACIS shipments, we'll have the seasonal factor."
1,"Probably within a month or two, we would definitely have the final decision, which would again be conveyed to you as soon as we are moving in that direction. As mentioned, we are addressing our capacity issues in Ahmedabad and probably in this quarter having resolved that, having getting a higher business expectation from the tender side and of course with the steady growth in Poultry, we hope that we close at a little higher growth than what we have shown in the nine months cumulatively ended so far. So with this, I will hand over the call to Jigar Shah, who will talk precisely on the financials with figures."
1,"Profit growth in Industrial and other businesses offset the impact of short-term profit downturns in Automotive and Energy. As shown here, businesses with steady profit growth are to support our mid and long-term automotive-related business strategies. This chart shows improvements in operating profit from the previous year."
1,"Q1 was another record quarter, highlighted by record results in our Prepared Foods segment. The ongoing investments in our businesses continue to provide consistent, stable growth as we are on track for our sixth straight record year. First quarter revenues were up over 11% to $10."
1,"Q107 in Toronto slipped to the sixth position while 102. 1 the Edge held steady and in Edmonton, 630 CHED once again made solid gains to take the number four ranking position. We had great results in both of our largest diary markets as well making impressive gains in the latest ratings book."
1,"Q4 2016 was exceptionally high. I think we reached 160% than the   and that's, of course, not an underlying steady volume. That was more of a nonrecurring situation we had."
1,"Q4 originations rose 97% from Q4 of last year, but were down 11% from Q3 reflecting typical seasonality. We continue to see a large opportunity in Brazil from a combination of its sizeable population, strong demand for credit, a stable regulatory environment and a modern banking system, Finally, Enova Decisions, our real-time analytics as a service business, continues to make good progress and gain traction with customers across several verticals. While this business is still in its very early stages, it's encouraging that we're able to generate millions of dollars in run rate revenue in our first full year in business."
1,"Q4, really, when you break down the different businesses, Concentrix, we do report separately, so you do see where our operating performance is there. Within Technology Solutions, if I do break down, our Distribution business grew at a clip, we believe, faster than overall market, but our gross margins held relatively steady in that part of the business. Westcon-Comstor was accretive to that overall business, and it was really our systems design business that, on the one hand, had much higher than forecasted revenue, and a big part of that was due to some unanticipated acceleration of shipments into Q4, but with that, it was really the mix of customers and products that we had in that incremental revenue, where the margins were on the lower end of what we actually supply out of that business, and that really was the reason that our margins were somewhat lower than   in Q4 for TS."
1,"Recurring maintenance and support revenue grew 12% to $23. 6 million, while our professional services and training revenue remained steady at $3. 5 million."
1,"Remember that as a second point that the big part of the point, the let's say the effervescence of Brazil is also the fact that they have duties which applies and will not be withdrawn. These duties are 14%, that applies on our products, a barrier, a stable barrier and there is absolutely no doubt that today we'll see. And the second point is that our strategy in Brazil has always been the same, strengthen the competitiveness of Brazil, continue to cancel all the effect of inflation and continue to work on the competitiveness of Brazil."
1,"Rental revenue growth of 27% year-over-year was driven by the acquisitions we completed in the last 12 months, and the strong growth profile of the portfolio. Stable assets, predictable cash flows and increasing acquisition opportunities in our targeted markets all continue to drive consistent growing quarterly results of the Partnership. With acquisition volume exceeding our target level for last year, we recently announced the distribution of $0."
1,"Results were strong, especially considering our timber product pricing conditions. Our focus on assembling premier timberlands, a delivered sales strategy, the steady improvement and harvest mix, and emphasis on sustainable earnings, all paid off during the year. Our successful fourth quarter capital raise and refinancing had materially strengthened the balance sheet and give us greater flexibility to pursue accretive acquisitions and joint ventures."
1,"Retail portfolio and forward-looking downside macroeconomic assumptions and the effect on the Canadian Retail portfolio. For the balance of the year and assuming economic conditions remain stable, our expectation is that credit losses will moderate over the next quarter and PCL should remain in the range of 40 basis points to 45 basis points. Let me conclude my remarks with just a brief summary of my key points."
1,"Revenue growth has seen very strong momentum and has grown at 44% year-on-year for this quarter. Our net interest income grew 45% for the quarter on a year-on-year basis and our NIM, which has been showing steady and consistent improvement quarter-on-quarter since last year now stands at 3. 89% in Q3, FY 2018."
1,"Right, sure. Sir, second question is, if you look our SAE business, as an there also the growth has been pretty steady   have been pretty strong 40% plus growth Y-o-Y, and with growth outlook improving what do you   as in what is your perception of this business, should we expect better growth and business opportunities from Brazil as in which has been there with respect to end markets to what extent can we tap that market through EPC business as well?"
1,"Right. And then, if   let's say, this sort of environment stays steady state through the next 18 months or so, would   is your mid-term guidance still achievable?"
1,"Right. Prices have been very stable; continues to be roughly   on a rough basis about $5 with combined trends of our legacy SATA controllers, pricing beginning to come off. But our new PCIe NVMe controllers are coming into our product mix at a higher level."
1,"Right. So you know see actually few things happened in the last few years, which are all trends that came in from different points of view and when we started this end of life products, we felt that we had a stable growth on our existing business. Unfortunately, the market changed faster than we thought and by and large, we found that the effort-based business was under a lot of threat."
1,"Right. So, if you take a look at our ASPs across, not just client SSDs, but also across all of the other product categories from cards and flash drives to eMMC, and now, client SSDs, they've been very stable over the last many years. Cards and flash drives have been very stable for the last seven-plus years at around $0."
1,"Roughly about a third of our business is in the non-residential construction, and that also includes infrastructure. So, it's a big part of our overall mix and we have had, as Jim just pointed out, some steady improvement over the past two or three years. But we've got, as Jim said, we've got our equipment in place, facilities in place, brick and mortar, et cetera, et cetera, that we can take on a lot more tonnage and add very little expense to our bottom line."
1,"S. , our MS revenues were stable versus 2016, and including OCREVUS royalties, MS revenues in the U. S."
1,"S. , when you think about the world as it would exist for you five years from now, is your view more that the decline of linear audience and ad supported audiences will find a floor and settle down, and sort of be stable, and therefore you'll be okay? Or is your view more that, no, those declines in viewership, at least linearly, will keep going down, but it's okay because you'll make it up in price on advertising and subscription fees and that's how you'll maintain stability or growth?"
1,"S. and Europe were stable, but I didn't hear the rest of your remarks. And so, if you could give us maybe a slight repeat and maybe elaborate a little bit, that would be wonderful."
1,"S. are benefiting the markets we serve, stable capital markets, which should benefit Chartwell in particular, as well as our private banking business, and tax reform should also benefit the clientele of all three of our businesses. Related to tax reform, what item we'd reinforced from yesterday's earnings release is our effective tax rate for this year."
1,"S. higher education courseware, where we expect revenue to be flat to down mid-single-digit percent, and the steady performance in the remaining 75% of our business. And with that, I'll hand back to you, John."
1,"S. in the last year, we kept our prices in local currency stable in order to stay competitive. We have a market share in the U."
1,"S. land-based activities, remained steady during the fourth quarter and comprise 36% of the segments quarterly revenue. Orders booked for the fourth quarter were a bit disappointing and totaled $80 million resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 0."
1,"S. oil and gas industry have been pressured over the past several years, our FGFD results have remained intact over that time due to the high-degree of recurring revenue in this product line and steady demand from international markets. Recent macro indicators in the energy industry point to a continued steady recovery moving forward."
1,"S. onshore growth engines and the DJ and Delaware Basins; followed by Mitch Ingram who will discuss our high margin and stable cash generating deepwater and international assets, which also benefit from established infrastructure, as well as our premier LNG project in Mozambique. Then Bob Gwin will discuss the benefits and value created through our control and ownership of Western Gas Partners."
1,"Sales in our traditional watch business, while still challenging, performed within our overall expectations. Sell-through trends of our traditional watches remained fairly stable in the Americas, though we did experience some declines in trends amongst certain of our wholesale partners. We continue to grow our connected watch business, delivering $142 million in sales for the quarter, 44% higher when compared to the fourth quarter of last year."
1,"Sales in Q3 grossed 41% driven by both our Harmony Hub family of products, as well as the solid contribution of Circle 2, our home security camera solution. Finally, PC peripheral sales were down 4% this quarter, yet sell-through, as I mentioned, remained very stable and consistent with our recent trends. Our latest products, including our new flagship keyboard, MX CRAFT, and our new trackball, MX ERGO, are off to a great start and contributed nicely to our results."
1,"Sales this quarter were 12% higher than the sales of the previous quarter. And as regards to Patient Assistance Program, as a percentage of total demand, it was generally stable compared to the third quarter of this year, which is what we were expecting knowing that the people that are enrolling ourselves in this program, they are enrolled for the full calendar year. We believe that the demand for Patient Assistance Programs as a percentage of total demand will decrease in 2018 as compared with what we saw in 2017."
1,"Same property cash NOI growth of 4. 1% was strong, exceeding the high end of our original forecasted range, due to solid rent growth and relatively stable occupancy. 2017 was the third consecutive year of strong same property cash NOI growth atop 6."
1,"Second, we now enter an era of methodical capital allocation as depicted in the slide. Our goal is to maintain a steady state leverage ratio of 2. 5 times."
1,"Secondarily, the combination will enable us to drive efficiencies by consolidating noninvestment functions, such as trading and operations, to continue the improvement in our margin over time. Aside from the tax impact in these significant items, our underlying business performance in 2017 reflected continued, consistent, and steady improvement and, most importantly, our client franchises continued to grow. On a segment basis, we had strong performance."
1,"Secondly, just looking at the sort of Bloomberg consensus this year, it looks like to get to that CHF 150 million EBIT, the Ocean GP per TEU would need to be somewhere near the sort of CHF 290, CHF 300 level. Everything you've said sort of hints that it   your expectation is it will be close to sort of stable on the Q4 level. But therefore, from what you said about the value-added services, how quickly could you ramp those up and would that be enough to bring the full year level up to that sort of CHF 280, CHF 290-ish level, or do we need to   or does consensus need to rethink that?"
1,"Secondly, still on Video. Rodolphe, in a recent interview, you spoke of your conviction around how Video was stable to slight growth over the medium term and how this had actually been informed by in-depth surveys you've done with broadcast customers. Would you ever consider publishing those surveys?"
1,"See, kind of our customer base, who are all single operators and who have income on the vehicle and their family also is dependent on the income of the vehicle, so it has been around 2% steady state for us. It has never been less than that."
1,"See, on the BAU basis, if you look at the steady improvement in the rating profile of our corporate loan book, over the last three, four quarters, if you look at the fact that we have a high provision coverage ratio of almost 60%. We have a floating provision of INR 70 crores, we have got SME 2 two at   SME 2, it's well below 1%, as I mentioned."
1,"See, this quarter we should be stable, because most of our fundraising will come through securitization. So we don't see any pressure on our borrowing cost."
1,"Shall there be any volatility in the interest rates, of course, the dynamics will be changing. But what I say that the structure and the composition of our assets and of balance sheet positions are all managed to keep the net interest margin in a reasonably stable level and provide a satisfactory return to equity. And for the fee and commissions side, that is   the question is whether you can do it 19% each and every, forever."
1,"Sir, and one final question on the margin front. Instead of an adverse movement in the yield curve and the higher share of newer vehicles, your NIM has been stable at around 7. 48%."
1,"Slide 11 summarizes our 2018 capital program, which reflects the simplification we've discussed. Even at a steady development pace, we expect to deliver 50% annual oil growth at the midpoint of our production guidance range and that would come on a smaller spending increase of around 20% at the midpoint and less than 30% at the high end of the range for capital expenditures. This places us near the top of the list of oily ENPs when it comes to capital efficiency."
1,"Slide 11 summarizes our 2018 capital program, which reflects the simplification we've discussed. Even at a steady development pace, we expect to deliver 50% annual oil growth at the midpoint of our production guidance range. And that would come on a smaller spending increase of around 20% at the midpoint and less than 30% at the high end of the range for capital expenditures."
1,"Slide 13 highlights how we expect our tax rate to evolve over time. Now, pertaining to our capital allocation policy and as we have stated in the past, it is our intent to share the growth in our steady state earnings with our shareholders in the form of progressive dividend increases. We believe that the tax reform will aid in accelerating that growth."
1,"So as we work through these projects as quickly as possible, we expect the negative drag from acceleration should lessen throughout the year. The solid starts and steady performance in the newer portion of our Large Project portfolio gives our team significant opportunities to deliver operational and financial performance improvement. The market remains robust and our emphasis remains targeted to disciplined project selection, partner selection, project duration and owner dynamics, all while keenly focused on associated risk and appropriate returns."
1,"So before we open up the call for questions, I wanted to summarize our outlook for fiscal 2018. So I think you can see clearly that we are off to an excellent start, and we expect fiscal 2018 to be a strong year due to tax reform, higher NFE contributions from Energy Services, and steady performance from our core businesses. Our regulated business segments including New Jersey Natural Gas are expected to contribute to between 40% and 55% in annual NFE."
1,So customer lifetime has really remained fairly constant. Our gross retention rates have been really pretty steady and there hasn't been a big shift. Where we think we're adding customer lifetime value though is by having upsells be a bigger component of our business overall.
1,"So even though this doesn't mean less cash out today, it definitely transforms in the end to a lower payment to the seller and a reduced price for the company we acquired in absolute terms. So we manage in this way to keep our multiples steady even though the   even if a financial performance in a certain business is lower than expected. If we turn now to page 7, you will see a similar layout, but for the full year 2017."
1,"So following are the levers. A stable real estate market backed by friendly RERA regulations, bidding of orders with agencies like MCGM, CPWD and other such reputed government   party government bodies which would carry forward the government's vision on housing creation, increased susceptibility of real estate builders to move to EPC contractors with a proven track record and high quality execution, improving efficiency by bidding for orders within the same project or premises which are mentioned as a potential to add INR 1,500 crores to INR 2,000 crores to our order book. And our working capital efficiency which will improve as we really release our retention monies with clients to replace it with bank guarantees on a credit rating front, we expect our interest cost to further come down."
1,"So for 2017, we ended sitting just above 11 million DISH TV subscribers, and we spent really the last two and a half years improving our subscriber mix, really by focusing in on acquiring or retaining long-term profitable customers, despite the tough competition with both cord cutting and aggressive bundled offers. The percent of newly acquired customers in our low competition or stable rural markets is definitely growing. And voluntary churn is down as we get back to our roots really, and focus in on adding rural customers."
1,"So I don't view the exchanges of our health reform being a major headwind or tailwind, if you will, for HCA. So it appears we're in a pretty stable environment, to your point, on the health insurance exchange activity. Going back to bad debts and uncompensated care, so the industry is adopting revenue recognition."
1,"So I think if you look at that on an organic basis, that's what the trend appears to be. But that's pretty different than the growth you were putting up a couple of years ago in these kind of steady double-digit growth when you saw a ton of airlines make the decision to outsource their..."
1,"So I think there is not so much more to say about the cocoa butter price than it's remained in the sweet spot. If we then go to page 20, the Technical Products & Feed, they have a very, very good quarter and this was mainly due to that they continue to improve the product mix for our fatty acid business and we are also seeing much more stable raw material prices now for some quarters, but also the Feed business developed positively in the quarter. Looking at EBIT per kilo, you can see an improvement of 29%."
1,"So I think we definitely still want to grow, and we're going to continue to look for things that fit us in and make us better, not just bigger, but they make us better. As Chris said, we think our investors value dividends to a certain degree, but they really value a steady dividend. And we're going to continue to monitor that, and see if it makes sense for us to look at further growing that dividend in time."
1,So I would say that we've seen an increase in some of that skilled mix in new buildings. We still feel like that the Medicaid business has been stable and strong and our operators continue to focus on that. But we've seen some uptick on skilled as well and a lot of our portfolio.
1,"So I'd say, feeling pretty optimistic. But I do think, to answer your question, it's very dependent on what it produces, a long-haul takeaway or their gas purchase contracts are out of the area as to how steady their drilling is going to be."
1,"So if I can kick off with slide number 4, given the ground that we will be covering today, I won't spend too much time on this slide. Suffice to say, our strategy is steady as she goes, with our focus on safety, active portfolio management, and tightly managing cost and capital to keep our balance sheet robust enough to handle any market environment. We are and will continue to invest for the longer term."
1,"So if we summarize quarter four, it's been a good safe performance, improved profitability, stable cash flow for the operating activities. Americas, we've had improved profitability, it's been clear in the market after the tax reform decision, and there are some more positive signals also in Brazil."
1,"So if you have there the right products and the right project you could place yourself there with many   with a lot of innovations. If we come to extrusion which is heavily involved in the aerospace market, that's ongoing stable as it was also in the course of 2016. What remains challenging in that sector as the IGT market."
1,"So in summary, if we can move to slide 11, it has been a very active 2017. I think, we've set ourselves up very well at San Francisco to return to stable production levels of between 90,000 and 100,000 ounces of gold. And this, we believe will provide a stable platform for us to continue to create value at Ana Paula through exploration and continue de-risking the project with further engineering and metallurgy."
1,"So just kind of more in the weeds here; so you guys, you've been surprised a little bit on pricing and subscriber additions last several quarters. Your ARR has been very rock-solid, however, is there I mean generalizing from the different things that have happened in the last few quarters, what has allowed you to keep that ARR steady despite surprises in your model on those other lines? And then looking forward, where could you be surprised?"
1,"So just very briefly to conclude, I think sort of despite the challenges in the operating environment, we've reported a solid performance for 2017 with Santander UK continuing to demonstrate resilience, as I said. Our focus remains on improving customer loyalty, operational and digital excellence and steady and sustainable growth. We remain mindful of the uncertain economic environment, but we are confident that as the only full-service scale challenger in the UK we can build upon the strong and sustainable foundations of our business."
1,"So lastly, I would like to mention and comment about the equity participations. As we shared with our investors in the last year's event, three main pillars of our strategic approach in managing our equity participations are focusing on our core businesses and financial services, booking value with increased transparency and business line alignment, ensuring a stable and satisfactory dividend stream. And through that approach, we continue to increase the transparency and simplify the structure of non-financial participations."
1,"So number one, the underlying operating performance of our business as measured by expense control and the growth in our base fee revenue is improving. Secondly, the diversification and resiliency of our business is showing up in the stability of our operating revenue yield and steady improvement in our margin. Third, the improvement in performance fees, first of all, reflects the fact that we are truly delivering for clients across a broadly diversified product set and recent performance fee growth is coming through both our legacy and our newer equity and alternatives affiliates."
1,"So our strategy has always been on fresh, and frozen was always a byproduct, mainly driven by supply balance issues because sometimes you have a higher supply depending on when the birds are planted. What has happened in the last two quarters   as our supply has become more stable, we now have the capability to seriously consider entry into frozen market. We are still trialing into a few regions."
1,"So Pete, I think the way we think about this is as follow. Over the next three years, if you look at what happens to Machine Clothing EBITDA, if we do our jobs right it remains steady, so no material change in cash flow from that business. On the other hand, AEC sees a rapid growth to 2020 both in sales and EBITDA margins, so out in 2020, so if we hit our targets it's over $500 million in sales with 18% to 20% EBITDA margin."
1,"So something has to give. So these are just macro indicators and all I can say is, when I look at the mix of our business and the competitive intensity of our products, we are taking advantage of our relatively modestly competitive portfolio in many areas to develop a more stable outlook. So just on, specifically in regard to the impairment note."
1,"So structural steel similarly not all are there, expect two large competitors. So we're now getting into diversification more and more, but our margins will remain steady and then so that there will be growth in even in margins also."
1,"So that amplified the impact on our internal tonnage. But if you look at that in the broader context of our stable trading range and how we think about tonnage, we were still very comfortable. In terms of looking forward, we will continue to focus on improving the efficiency of our promotions."
1,"So that's how we're paying ourselves on short-term incentive based on our ability   and not, by the way, am I   you're right our guidance doesn't have us there, so I'm not suggesting that our guidance has us hitting it. What I'm saying is it's still in the range of $3 billion, $5 billion, $7 billion and this feels like a year at least looking at it right now that isn't one of the   is somewhat a below-average year for our steady state earnings power. The reason I believe that is because fuel prices have run up so quickly."
1,"So the inflation plus pricing will be now be more driven versus value of capacity than necessarily the service. And our philosophy at CN is that pricing is something that we want to see slow but steady compound over 3, 5, 10 years and then we don't have to give back what we've earned. So we're not trying to get a 5%, 6%, 7%, 8% price increase because eventually the long-term model of our industry become at risk."
1,"So there are still a few things early on in the year that have to play out that really will determine where we sit on that guidance range in terms of same-site NOI. We do like the demand we're seeing from our stable of tenants that continue to want to grow stores with us. We see that that's very, very strong."
1,"So there's been good progress there and I'll touch later on some of the strategic aspects of this. If we turn next then to our business-to-business customer channel for Agri-Inputs, and firstly turning to fertilizer which delivered a satisfactory performance really on the back of lower underlying volumes against a higher seasonality of demand in 2017, we would say margins were stable in the period and again positively supported by continuing momentum in the sales of specialty and bespoke nutrition applications. In relation to Bunn Fertiliser, we think against the later timing of the acquisition in 2017 this business has performed well in the first six months and it's now fully integrated, and that's an important milestone for the business."
1,"So there's no huge difference in terms of proposition given by Paper Boat in the 1 liters, which is the one which is being discounted and what we have. So I think we need to lubricate the trade more, we need to advertise more and there is obviously a strong consumer preference for our brands, which should translate into business once the price levels are little bit more stable."
1,"So those are the main impacts that we see in commodity versus our expectations we had before for Q4. I think, again, going forward we see our big four commodities so far look stable versus prior year."
1,"So those customers will bring them onboard, they'll get up and running and that will be future growth out through 2018. So the primary growth in any short-term period is going to be our account management growth or are the huge base of thousands of customers which is steady growth for us. And the benefit of that is that gives us excellent visibility and predictability on revenue in any short-term time period because we have a large base of customers growing, we have this account base and we know it's growing."
1,"So up 8% in Q4 and a very strong order intake in Q4. I suppose what you can also see is that steady margins, a little bit more room for improvement in our Americas business particularly in South America as we continue to integrate that business into the group, very strong margins maintained throughout the year in Europe and the Rest of the World from those restructuring benefits that we took in the second half of 2016. So, all in all, very encouraging signs on both sides of the pond."
1,"So we decided to set about a program to exit these both high-priced and high-volatility deposits. The gap was such that we were going to have to use institutional funding, which of course is stable and reliable albeit high cost. So, as we've said, we may not like the geography from an organic deposit standpoint, but the range of cost differential is modest."
1,"So we do work on some projects and programs for the Ministry of Defense. And I would say, overall, our outlook is stable from 2017 to 2018. Not as robust as the U."
1,"So we don't see a big change. For us on our margin side, really the issue is we're assuming prices stay stable. We're not counting on significant increase although we're already starting to see improvement in pricing and we expect as the supply-demand balances tighten towards the back end of the year that there's more positive momentum in that direction."
1,"So we should benefit from the full year impact of the volume and price increases which we achieved in the course of 2017 especially in the second half plus some additional moderate increase. Oil & Gas activity should remain stable overall in Brazil with the renewal of our frame agreement with Petrobras which is expected in the first half of this year. Whereas in the Rest of the World, we foresee an increasing tendering activity for the sale for Oil & Gas projects."
1,"So we're 25%, and really it's going to be driven by the combined ratio. And given our expense ratio, it will be relatively stable, it's really going to be driven by losses. So our view is   so we're at kind of 16% to 17% in 2018, looking forward, which is what I'm sure you guys are looking at too."
1,"So we're continuing to grow, but clearly not at the   we're not growing in at the pace we would have probably three or four years ago. So, it's kind of slow and steady there, but I think our share we look at it, look for one of six guys. I think pricing and competition is relatively stable in terms of our view is   so we set that range at 13% to 15%, that's really just being conservative on our part."
1,"So we've got strong results underpinned by the Hellaby acquisition and continued good performance of the business segments. Our Trade, Bapcor New Zealand, formerly Hellaby Auto, and Specialist Wholesale segments are growing strongly, and the retail profit is stable in a challenging environment and during our transitioning strategy. So our operating highlights on page 6 that 2018 is a year which is focused on consolidation, following a solid expansion phase."
1,"So we've kind of always said as, you know, once prices stabilize, it's like, you know, it   basically there's a three to six month lag, so if prices go up, it takes three to six months to go and of course, the opposite happens on the way down. So, on a stable environment   once you get stabilized for a while, you know, it's going to reach its natural course. I think one of the things that has happened over the past several quarters now is that just has continued to increase."
1,"So what I said before is that we actually assume that the current level will stay, which means that adjusted for seasonality which is obviously there with different booking conversions, et cetera, that the commercialization. So our share of the overall value will, relatively speaking, be stable. So we don't think that there will be a readjustment but if you, I mean going forward, but if you compare obviously to last year, we saw a very, very positive development in Q1 and Q2 2017 and also in Q4 2016."
1,"So what I'm pleased about our pipeline is the advancement from 12 months ago to today with some of the additional movement of our pipeline and we'll be happy to talk about that later too, as we've advanced some of the programs. Our R&D transformation is aimed at building an innovative and sustainable pipeline, which will deliver a steady stream of products and growth drivers for years to come. We continue to assess the pipeline regularly to prioritize and accelerate key programs."
1,So what we've done   so overall our weighted average cap rate is stable at 6. 47%.
1,"So while you say that we should not look at 20%, we've done our own math and looked at what if in a steady state what kind of growth we would have shown last year and what is the additional growth that's come. And I repeat my point here again Vikash that out of the 20% we believe 10% is because of base impact and 10% is a normal growth."
1,"So you really have to think about dollar-based retention, which is inclusive of customers contracting with you. So that has held steady, but what we have seen is, even within our existing base, the customers that are larger obviously, have a lower churn and contraction. So of course, as we move up market, we're going to see that trend in our business mix as well."
1,"So you'll see us invest wisely around where we see the real opportunities to grow this business, but we will not starve areas of the business that we know are important and we'll do it prudently and wisely. And I believe we can get all four businesses in a good stable position, but I come around again to say it won't always be perfect. In any business that has the type of excellent portfolio spread wide that we do, there's always going to be areas that are accelerating and doing well and areas that we're working on."
1,"So, any spread tightening that may occur in future will be incremental to our full return expectations. In conclusion, we are very pleased with the performance of our portfolio during the year, and we believe that it continues to be well-positioned to deliver attractive long-term core earnings and a relatively stable book value. With that, we will open up the call to questions."
1,"So, as you can see, there is quite a huge difference. We are basically the only steady positive NPS operator in Italy, and this is simply a consequence of our infrastructure, a consequence of our focus in upgrading our network. Netflix is just an external reference because sometimes operator tends to be auto-referential."
1,"So, at the end of the day, how the capital is managed whether the first question   I guess the question asked is whether we have excess capital as well, what we see going forward with the dividend, whether a special dividend, is one of the mechanism where we use to manage our capital. And we would ultimately want to provide our guidance to the market that the dividend that we want to pay out is a steady, rising one without necessarily sort of having volatility rising more because from the way we manage our capital whereas sometimes you might have excess and sometimes you might have a deficit. We want to be able to sort of provide the guidance and really ratchet it up when we are more comfortable in terms of the performance."
1,"So, catch up in LW108 and primarily LW108 and the mains that have been developed at this stage. So, and then,   then, as I say the resources that we've deployed right now, there'll be a reduction in those back to what will be a steady state requirement for that systematic secondary support regime."
1,"So, correspondingly, what happened is that the capital arising from these subsidiaries would not be included for the group itself, and the deduction is based off the cost of investment in terms of Great Eastern. So, in the sense that as long as we do not increase our investment into Great Eastern, that deduction coming from Great Eastern investment itself will be steady. Now, the second part of it is that because we are not including the subsidiaries arising from Great Eastern itself, the corresponding RWA arising from Great Eastern is also taken out from the risk weighting of the group, which is why if you look at the details of the financial itself, you will notice that in terms of capital, it's a decline even though we have earnings increased."
1,"So, first, let me start by talking about the Refinish business, and why we should care about it, and why it continues to be a big part of Axalta's performance. So first, the Refinish market continues to be very stable, consolidating around four major players and it continues to grow in excess of 3% a year. Axalta holds a 25% global market share in the $7 billion refinish industry."
1,"So, for this year 2018, as we have to continue investing in marketing acquisition both in LDA as well as in Bankinter Consumer Finance, and we will continue investing in IT and our new digital teams. We are forecasting   we have our guidance of mid-single digit range with a more stable quarterly performance."
1,"So, great job taking out all those costs. With some investments for the new products kind of offsetting ongoing cost reductions, is this kind of a stable level we should be thinking about for modeling or do you see that slightly going up or down based on your plans?"
1,"So, hopefully, this collaboration or this partnership will help us bring down the new customer acquisition cost, which will obviously be a benefit in terms of our margin improvement. But our strategy will continue to be the same as in the last several years which is we will try to grow our topline as fast as possible while maintaining a stable margin. So, again, for the foreseeable future, we'll continue to reinvest our   the benefits or the profits that we've got from either lower customer acquisition cost or higher operating leverage to drive faster topline growth."
1,"So, I mean, I think when you look at where we are at, what we've done relative to the appeals process when it's been an option to appeal; and we felt like we can reduce the taxes, we do so. So, I think it's pretty steady when you look at the fourth quarter going forward."
1,"So, I say that if you look at a three months lag kind of time period, I think quarter four there may not be major fluctuation, however, we start feeling the impact from quarter one onwards of some amount of raw material increase. I'd say 50% of our raw material has gone up, 50% is stable or gone a little bit down. So that's how broadly I was trying to classify going forward in quarter one, will not be more than about 5%, 6% increase in quarter one."
1,"So, I think we need to keep our foot down, where strategically we're a bit weak as we don't have that big bed rock of earnings that some of our major global competitors have that can help us withstand the variability and the volatility in earnings and our trading businesses and we need to work on that too. So, we do have this balancing of capital allocation to businesses that provide us with a steady stream of revenues, profits and capital creation versus some of our trading businesses, which when the markets are good, are great, but when the markets are quite or even half moribund as they were at the back end of last year, they don't look very effective."
1,"So, if you look at our record for 10 years, you'll see that whether things are going up or going down, we are steady at 25%."
1,"So, if you were to make no further acquisitions once we exited 2018, you'd expect your revenue per case to be stable going forward?"
1,"So, it's difficult to say exactly how the quarter is stacking up from a market share gain standpoint. Our market share, as I've indicated in the past and as the current data which is through the second quarter of 2017 indicates, is stable. And it hasn't been growing like it did in the previous periods as we've indicated in the past."
1,"So, it's going to be hard to say. The market for our products will need to either be stable or improve. For that to happen, if there's a retreat in those market, that's going to be a whole lot harder."
1,"So, it's not that tremendous. But we do think we're approaching, I'll call it, the bottom and have the right strategies, both on the top line as well as restructuring our operations over there from a cost standpoint, to respond to the marketplace and create a more stable environment for us as we go into 2018."
1,"So, last year, up 15%. We're going to continue to invest money in increasing our dividends, recognizing the very steady cash flows that we experienced. And then the last piece would be share repurchase, and so if you look back over the last seven or eight years, we've repurchased   retired almost half of our float."
1,"So, let me wrap up. We saw stable or increasing market shares in our major markets and continue to see strong growth in our online business. The integration is now substantially completed with synergies coming in ahead of plan, leading to margin expansion."
1,"So, most of what we manage is not subject to redemption and based on how we charge management fees, whether it be off invested or committed. So, markets could tumble tomorrow on asset prices and again, our management fee streams are stable and insulated nicely against that. So, that gives us as we think about FRE as being the pegged for the dividend, we thought a lot of that was based on the comfort level of what drives FRE and that's a very stable management fee stream."
1,"So, no real change there with some of the balance. And still an environment where with a slower second-hand market and high stamp duty levels, the upper ends of our product range more broadly are definitely slower in terms of   sales rates are very stable in terms of price than the more core products sort of which is majority of our business, so upper end London, definitely a bit slow still. But really, no change from the comments that we made at our last trading update or through the majority of last year, to be honest."
1,"So, our ability to be effective at bringing safe, new productive areas online is going to be key to where we go in the future. So, again, if we look at production having a stable, consistent platform by the end of this year, we expect to have three mines running and certainly, I believe there's flexibility within our property at any point in the future to have more than that providing flexibility in the productive capacity. Our optimization studies, we're looking at this year, to look at what is the best way to add value at Cerro Negro."
1,"So, overall if you look at our customer acquisition there has been no real change, it's been fairly steady. In the future we're anticipating that there is going to be more in terms of third-party cooperation and working with other organizations and in particular other financial institutions, so we believe that in the future, a significant portion of growth will actually come from this third-party cooperation."
1,"So, overall, I think it was a very commendable and a credible year of 2017. Just driving down still further into the P&L, our material costs remained robust, remained stable I'd say at 64. 8% for the year as against 65% last year and also personnel expenses at INR 796 crores versus INR 750 crores of last year and this is more due to the annual increments which we did every year and   but whereas if you look at the productivity per person, it has definitely increased by more than 15%."
1,"So, overall, our total revenue remained relatively flat, finishing at â‚¬300 million for 2017 versus â‚¬301 million for 2016. Our gross margin remains relatively stable at 70% over the three periods presented. But it has a changing mix inside of it."
1,"So, probably only increasing about 40% of the increase in demand for palladium. So, if we tie that all together, we see that our view on platinum is that it remains fairly stable. In the auto sectors we spoke about, we see growing heavy duty demand, we see growing light duty outside of Western Europe, and we see the potential for substitution back into gasoline."
1,"So, profiled waste growth, we'd said we expect that profiled waste to grow double digits. Continuous improvement, I mentioned the stable operations activities and how we're going to expand those to even more of our large tip fee facilities. Increased metal volumes, think the non-ferrous system in Pennsylvania."
1,"So, such gains won't have an impact in the future contribution from our debt portfolio. That said, we believe that we can keep our debt portfolio contribution to NII stable going forward, even if we realize some additional gains in the future quarters."
1,"So, that   I mean, that's    it used to be 24 million pounds under the HEU agreement plus, so that's down to 10 million pounds. We kind of count that, I think, in our books as being kind of a steady stream that's going to come for a long time from the Russians."
1,"So, that was made pretty clear to us from the rating agency. So, yes, I think as you can see from our results, we had a very good year, very steady, making good progress. We think we're doing the things that are important in running the business."
1,"So, that was the bulk of the impairment for Q4. In terms of SGD 3 billion, maybe I'll let CK jump in as well, but I think we looked at what we could do more in terms of meeting our ROE target; and we noticed that we have a wonderful investment portfolio, coupled with where we are in this cycle, coupled with a good stable of mature contributing assets. So, when you add those three together, then it allowed us to come up with this number as a sustainable target to aim for."
1,"So, that would be my priority. Our dividend process should be long-term in nature, consistent with the kind of business we do and that would be a more steady move, right? That I wouldn't think you'd make large scale changes in your dividend approach."
1,"So, the activity is starting to increase. I'd expect it to be a pretty steady ramp through the course of 2018. I think we've talked publicly about trying to add 150 to 200 people in technology and a similar number into our services organization."
1,"So, the SG&A, I mean, growth rates still maintain around 7% to 8% which has already incorporated our 3% pay hike effective early this year. Supposedly, our CI ratio would maintain stable at around 46% this year. So, it's still similar to what we projected in our last quarter's meeting."
1,"So, the way to think about that is we may lose tonnage in certain categories as we did in Q4 and we'll be watching it very closely. Our expectation is to continue to trade at the lower end of our stable trading range for tonnage through the year but not go below that."
1,"So, there's some modest increase from it, but as you know, many variables. And as Mark said earlier, when we look at our same-store analysis, we feel that the market is stable. So, it's not a big mover, but we did notice the change."
1,"So, we do have to be proactive in that regard. We are seeing actually quite strong success in the first quarter of this year from our Beer Festivals business which is a business we've actually had and run for quite a long time, but which has been a steady generator of cash flow and in this year actually has been quite strong. So, I would point to that as a business we continue to leverage."
1,"So, we do think there is further yield compression to come in the market, but probably at slightly more subdued rates than we've seen last year. And all the time that the backdrop to the market   so, I think we're looking forward in the medium term, we're seeing much more of a picture of rent moving from less of a capital growth model in our market driven by yield compression to looking at yield stability underpinned by high-quality in growing rental growth and, therefore, it's going to be much more of an income-driven site, albeit, of course, with growing income translating on steady-state cap rates, you are going to see capital growth intrinsic within the balance sheet."
1,"So, we saw expected declines in productivity during those holiday stretches. But absent that, the utilization was pretty steady throughout our quarter."
1,"So, we think release some cap gains for Europe should be there. The only thing we   and if you think on the cost side, our cost result is likely to be stable. The one thing where you can see some downward pressure is the mortality result simply because the book will shrink over time."
1,"So, we think that's a good solid place to start. We do expect to gain share in each of our markets and you don't gain 20 points a share in five minutes, it's a slow steady process, 0. 5% here, 0."
1,"So, we're optimistic that 2018 could be the breakout year for well servicing. It's always been one of our most stable businesses with great margins, as we've talked before. Even during 2015 and 2016, we generated positive EBITDA throughout the down cycle, and it's a great stable business, and we're excited that we may have the opportunity to increase that utilization and bring that pricing up in this year."
1,"So, we've demonstrated our capabilities to grow even though they get   they have alternate sources of funds, they are not dependent on the efficiencies of an NBFC of not raising funds from other sources. We are as good as any other source for them, plus our competency is to grow our own distribution strength, ensure that we will have a very stable and a consistent growth going forward."
1,"So, when there is   we need long-term leases we have to be sure we are not kicked out suddenly. So, in those countries we bought our own real estate at the moment they become more stable. We sell it off, and that's what you saw last year."
1,"So, while there is still a long way to go before we attain a full recovery, I'm encouraged by the direction we are heading as we entered into 2018 with our highest tank trailer backlog, again, since 2015. In our AVTE business, performance improvement actions, including facility consolidation, labor optimization and inventory reduction efforts, have all contributed to create a more stable, predictable operating environment. Backlog has increased nicely over the past six months, driven by a focused commercial effort providing much needed support to the top line."
1,"So, you know, another two to three rate hikes will probably get us to that point. So I think our securities portfolio for now stable as a percentage of total with a bias towards probably increasing once we do get little closer to where we think the Fed's terminal rates are."
1,Solid underlying demand for Sydney CBD prime office is expected to largely absorb the upcoming stock of new office maintaining relatively tight vacancy over the next five years. The Melbourne CBD prime office market is anticipated to remain tight in 2018 off the back of steady absorption and limited completions. Leasing conditions however are anticipated to soften as the current development pipeline expands Melbourne's office market and the prime CBD vacancy rate is forecast to increase towards 8% over the next few years.
1,"Some of the practices we talked about like locking the schedule for a week, this sounds very elementary, but traditionally, our plants have taken calls from customers, calls from general managers and yin-yang that schedule around all week. I think that also helps us when we lock for a week and give that guy a chance to win, we'll be very stable in the four walls, but we can also sync up much better with transportation in this very scarce market. So the integrated benefit of both of those, we think, is going to yield results real quickly."
1,"Some patients got up to 60%, which would translate up to about an 85% reduction. And at the time we did our last sample, 70% of the patients were still   the mutant huntingtin protein was still declining, so we believe that at steady state, you're probably going to get an average reduction in the CSF of about 60% which would translate to about a 75% to 85% reduction in the cortex. This translates to a very substantial reduction in the mutant huntingtin protein in the brain."
1,"Sometimes, the seasonality of the business will change impact on a short-term basis. But we're a very stable business with a very strong balance sheet, and I wouldn't get too upset about fluctuations in one number or the other just because we know that this is a business that will always be stable for us anyhow because what we do is very necessary, to provide comfort with our products when the climate is hot or when the climate is cold. So we take a long-term view about that, and we emphasize our record of total shareholder return."
1,"Steady growth is the expectation, within a few quarters, it's at now 2% of our overall mix, we would expect to see steady growth going forward throughout 2018 and 2019."
1,"Steve, our view is it's a pretty steady throughout the year. We're not seeing any big outliers, one direction or the other."
1,"Strong markets with revenue growth over 3% are Denver, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles. Our steady markets with revenue growth over 2% are the Bay Area, Washington D. C."
1,"Sure, Geoff. So to answer your first question, I do believe the range that I provided for you for tax rates are stable. I don't know if it's   it's not necessarily the overall mix, per se, of our revenue."
1,"Sure, happy to. So I think in the fourth quarter, we saw really a fairly stable competitive environment. There was a bit of a shakeout in our industry in 2017, I think we've benefited from that overall."
1,"Sure. So, the first question is on margins, so last year, we've have seen a steady jump in margin from Q3 to   for full year because we revised our estimates on the persistency. So this year also for the full year, is it reasonable to expect that the margins will be up about a 14."
1,"Sweden and Norway are stable but it's a slower sales pace, especially in Stockholm and Oslo. The other parts of our geography are more stable and also the affordable segment is also pretty much in line with 2016, which was a record year when it comes to Residential Construction and Residential Development. Europe, robust market in Central Europe."
1,"tax rate. Our estimate is our ETR on a steady state should go down by about 1%, but some of the further impacts are still being studied and we continue to work on the SUV ramp ups, which could further reduce the tax rate in coming years. As we saw, we have the highest cash position of about INR 1,077 crores or $167 million."
1,"TBAs will remain a core part of our investment, supplemented by specified pools that feature superior liquidity, attractive carry and rapid pay-up of breakevens. Our current investments in credit-related assets, particularly CRTs, will provide attractive and stable returns going forward, enable us to operate at a lower leverage multiple and reduce the risks associated with swaps. Our equity allocation of credit assets at the end of the fourth quarter is approximately 41% of the total amount of our equity tied up in haircuts for repo."
1,"Thank you again for taking an additional question. I was looking at slide 8 in your presentation included within the webcast, which shows that the gross profit margin for Loma Negra was kind of stable on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter of 2017 relative to the fourth quarter of 2016 at 29%. But obviously, the company achieved very good improvement in terms of some in general and administrative costs as a portion of sales dropping from 10."
1,"Thank you, and congratulations, everyone, on a good all-around quarter as well. Scott, you said that Cloud, Server and Data Center all did well, but over the course of the last six months or so, have you seen any change with respect to the mix of new or existing customers adopting your cloud offerings or do you say that that's been stable overall?"
1,"Thank you, Jeff. Although we have tempered our guidance for the full year, CSI is a stable company and there are several important catalysts that will drive growth in the months ahead. We are forecasting attractive sequential revenue growth in Q3 and Q4 due to improving sales productivity and limited market release of procedure support products and our commercial launch in Japan."
1,"Thank you, Jon. Maybe taking the questions in reverse order, if I could, maybe if that's okay, is in terms of the strength in Q1 and moving quicker, I think the one feature that I wouldn't want to go unnoticed is our revenue line is continuing to stabilize and is stable. The entire focus and trust from myself and a key commercial people is on focusing on our customers and deepening our relationships and making sure that we're able to fully participate in the growth, in the opportunities in our core market, as we go through all the other reshaping in the group."
1,"Thank you, Lidio. Excluding the impact of Hurricane Maria, our fourth quarter results reflected strong margins, healthy net interest income, and stable credit metrics. Maria impacted our results for the quarter in several revenue and expense categories due to the disruption of operations following the hurricane."
1,"Thank you, Ricardo. And if I may just a quick follow-up on your response with regard to the margin in Iberia given that you expect like a stable margin in Iberia in 2018. Is it fair to assume given that you've made most of your price investments back-end loaded into 2018 and that the remodeling will be a big component of H1 2018 that we should see margin being down a triple-digit basis points figure in H1, and then you expect a strong rebound rather into H2?"
1,"Thank you, Roy, and good morning, everyone. We ended 2017 with yet another solid quarter where we delivered against our financial framework with our focus on stable trading and creating efficiencies to drive operating leverage. In the fourth quarter, on an adjusted consolidated basis, our reported revenue declined 0."
1,"Thank you. Carlos, if you just go back to that last question about the macro and the relatively strong labor markets, and maybe this isn't kind of the right metric to look at, but your pays per control have stayed relatively stable over the last three years. Could you perhaps at least make the connection between what we're seeing in the underlying labor markets and that particular metric?"
1,"Thank you. The second question actually relates to I think the earlier comments you made on your revenue margins that you expect this to be kind of broadly stable on a blended basis going forward. Would that   I mean, given the increase in inflow into private debts, would that suggest that your new mandates in private equity are coming in at a higher revenue margin than your legacy portfolios?"
1,"Thankfully, Crombie's core business is strong, e-commerce-resilient, and a wonderful complement to our development opportunity. In closing, our core portfolio remains strong as is clear by our leasing spreads, occupancy, same asset NOI growth, improving payout ratios and our predictable and stable growth. As we look to the future, we remain acutely focused on creating long-term unitholder value through disciplined capital allocation, through the performance of our core property portfolio and through our development and intensification programs."
1,"Thanks for the question on our investment in wages and benefits. As you appreciate, having a highly talented, stable workforce is critical in our business. And as we looked at the labor markets, as we looked at where we stacked up competitively, we made an evaluation market-by-market to increase wage levels and enhance maternity and paid time off benefits, focused on our hourly workers."
1,"Thanks, Blake, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter earnings demonstrated our solid holiday execution ending the year with clean inventories and stable merchandise margins. We maintained a strong financial position marking the ninth consecutive year of generating more than $1 billion in operating cash flow."
1,"Thanks, Dave. Although point to point quarter end loan balances were down, average loan balances increased in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter by about $49 million, which combined with the Fed increase in mid-December resulted in an increase in net interest income and relatively stable net interest margin rate. We continue to see a competitive environment for funding, but should see some improvement in net interest income in the first quarter, as we realize a full quarter of the Fed increase."
1,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning to everyone on the call or listening in. Turning to net interest income and margin on slide 7, net interest income was stable compared to the third quarter and up $31 million or 36% compared to the same period in 2016 consistent with our overall expectations. On a linked quarter basis, the fourth quarter benefited from loan growth and higher loan fees, offset by a $1."
1,"Thanks, Mike. Starting on slide 4 of the earnings presentation, you can see our loan growth continued its steady pace this quarter. For the full year, loans are up 26% in total, and our 6."
1,"Thanks, Mitch. We're pleased to report another quarter of stable book value as we have largely cleaned up what remains of our problem loans. Net realized and unrealized losses for the fourth quarter totaled $0."
1,"Thanks, Pat. With the year more than halfway through, we have another solid base from which to continue our steady performance. I know we're not very sexy, but the market has had its ups and downs and when you look at our performance charts over the past 13 years as a public company, you will see steady, predictable results which has driven the continuation of our dividend over that period."
1,"That actually has upticked from a cost perspective even though from a head count perspective, it is not as high as it used to be. And I think it's fair to assume that as we continue to find leverage for the growth, on a percentage basis, our selling costs will probably be fairly stable, because we don't use growth to feed back for the growth."
1,"That does not mean that we will not see slight margin decreases or improvement, but the erratic changes and the pressure, especially the first six months 2017, we do not expect for this year. So, our assumption for this year is rather for the whole year are rather stable margin development. The Alibaba question, we do not disclose details on customers usually, but our e-commerce fulfillment solution and that is combined also with the KN FreightNet solution for Airfreight, for example, has seen a lot of growth and volume development over the last 12 months."
1,"That guidance reflects the stability in our business as our new agreement with LG has roughly offset the expiration of a few agreements at the end of 2017. And of course we hope to build on that stable base by adding new license agreements and renewals during 2018. As previously discussed, we expect that any new fixed fee agreements we sign or renew are likely to qualify for over time recognition under the new revenue recognition standard."
1,"That has now changed to approximately 5,000 marines from Okinawa to Guam, and it is going to be spread out over a longer period of time rather than a relatively short timeframe. So, we don't see much of that happening in 2018, and that gives our views of the market implicit in our guidance for 2018 around Guam was that we see the market as relatively stable. We do expect it to come."
1,"That is why our strategy of rebalancing our loan portfolio by replacing residential mortgages and multi-family loans with diversified commercial loans is so important, as this will allow us to offset lost accretion income and increase our core loan yields and NIM. In the fourth quarter, we grew traditional C&I and commercial finance loans by $368 million, while multi-family loans were stable and residential mortgage loans decreased by $227 million. Longer term, we're targeting a loan portfolio with a mix of 45% C&I, 45% CRE   45% CRE and multi-family and 10% residential mortgage and consumer."
1,"That is, however, about 3% lower than the market on average in Sweden, which grew by 7% year-on-year. And prices that the clients of ours meet have been stable and there's been a marginal increase in the average margin for our mortgage products, mainly driven by lower funding costs. On the SME side, we continued to gain market share a little bit less paced than before, but we've added 7,000 new SME clients in Sweden."
1,"That means we had a key substantial product that was tied to $104 million of demand deposits and it brought an annualized $200,000 of treasury fee income. If we stay on that path, we won't grow the muni book at all, so we'll have the noise from the muni book, but it'll become less relevant, and we'll grow and our cost of funds will end up being stable. And if we have a rising rate environment, then that's how we win."
1,"That said, for fourth quarter, we do expect to have a continued foreign exchange headwind, both on margin and the bottom line in the fourth quarter. We expect in the fourth quarter on the bottom line to have FX, if rates remain stable to where they are today, of negative $0. 02 for the fourth quarter."
1,"That said, we are now well-positioned entering 2018. Our commercial real estate portfolio held steady at 276% of bank regulatory capital as our dedicated CRE team successfully replaced CRE loan run-off through the fourth quarter and continued to rebuild their loan pipelines. As of December 31, we have significant capacity to grow our CRE portfolio while keeping our overall concentration under the threshold of 300% of regulatory capital."
1,That trend has moderated. We believe it's at a more stable level today and we continue to see a very stable outlook in the core of our business.
1,"That will be a catalyst in our fourth quarter from where things   where we thought things were 90 days ago. And overall this   our general end-market demand within our consumer end markets and our process industry end markets has remained stable for us, and in some cases, has gotten a little better. So those are the kind of things that have given us a little more conviction going into the fourth quarter about some better growth rates in PMC."
1,"That will happen from time to time. But overall, the credit quality in the C&I book   and as we've grown our small business book over the last two or three years, and that's been nice and steady growth, we do expect that to tick up a little bit, more of some seasonality but nothing really in there in this C&I book other than that. It's healthy."
1,"That will outpace global light vehicle production which is expected to be flat. This forecast includes double-digit CTOH growth, light vehicle revenue roughly in line with the industry production and a steady contribution from our global aftermarket business. And to reiterate, the full year, we anticipate 5% top-line growth, which is a strong outlook given production growth of just 2%."
1,"That's a critical milestone for us that that package of brands is growing and that we have POS and our shipping aligned. As we think about the Toy Box, we are focused on remixing that to be a more stable and profitable growth of properties, both within our entertainment partnerships, where we think about not just the A1 licenses that we're really committed to, but also as we think about innovative new coproduction arrangements which will have a much more attractive profit profile. As we think about our own brands, obviously we're focusing on the areas that we know that we have distinctive capabilities and also are very accretive to our franchise as you think about our expertise in dolls and girls properties, our expertise in gaming and games, where we've been very successful, which is one of the reasons we're investing in an expansion of our UNO product that you'll see at Toy Fair."
1,"That's now clinically moved over to a new operator as well. So we do see strong capital markets for these assets and that, combined with kind of steady to slightly rising patient counts, should help us move our way through this."
1,"That's okay. Starting with the universal service assumptions in the plan, we kept the contribution from the government steady over the course of the plan and the mention of revisiting and reviewing pricing of products cover by universal service is an ongoing activity that we do formally with the government. So it's all pre-agreed and settle with the authorities."
1,"The 25% tax rate is at the upper end of what we have previously guided, and that really is just a consequence of the mix that we expect next year. There are also some amortization of DTA expenses that we anticipate during the year, which pushes the tax rate above what our normal steady state tax would be. And so that adds a couple percentage to the overall tax rate going forward."
1,"The Â¥400 billion in the stable core operating cash flow announced in the Medium-Term Management Plan is intended to show the confidence our top management had in the figure in the sense that even at the bottom of the commodity market such as the one seen when we suffered losses in the year ended March 2016, we can generate enough amount to pay the dividend. Now, the recent business environment was so favorable that we built up significant amounts of profit not just in the Resources segment, but also in non-Resources segment."
1,"The acquisition increases both our personal and commercial auto volume while providing us with significant scale in Florida and Texas, which are fast growing and attractive markets. Our three unique businesses provide stable and diversified sources of cash flow that enable greater capital efficiency and the opportunity for an enhanced investment returns. With the combination of Infinity and Kemper, we believe we are bringing together two complementary organizations."
1,"The attrition that we experienced in Q4 2017 was a lag effect of the challenges that those customers experienced in late Q1 and Q2, not because they had problems in Q4. So we've been seeing steady progress since the end of Q2 in terms of how we're working with our customer, our customer satisfaction scores and, clearly, I've seen nothing new in the last 40 days that would indicate that we will have higher-than-normal attrition like we had in the fourth quarter. All of our trends have been improving steadily and there have been nothing in terms of new customer attrition that I would announce over the last 40 days, that's for sure."
1,"The bank remains steadfastly committed to our key pillars, highest possible credit quality, capital strength and exceptional differentiated client service. We've always focused on the longer term and remain steady in our approach to that. In this regard, we're continuing to invest in our systems, our people and our client services."
1,"The banking, there's a big element of uncertainty around that. But overall, we believe our contract business will get steady growth and you'll see the impacts in the second half of the year. The uncertainty to the UK is still permanent."
1,"The business case that we had on all of these products, we are performing to the business case. Our profit   our EBIT margins have been stable. As Anil mentioned, our return on capital employed has also been stable."
1,"The company continues to be the market share leader in North America in a large, growing and highly fragmented category with the opportunity for additional share gains as we leverage our scale in innovation, marketing and procurement. We have a good balance between a steady bridal business, a fashion, gifting and self-purchasing business and the design, repair and maintenance business, which continues to drive traffic to our stores after a purchase has been made. Additionally, our bridal and anniversary businesses involve big-ticket items that are purchased infrequently and often after careful deliberation with the assistance of a knowledgeable trusted sales professional."
1,"The company holds a strong liquidity position with available funds, totaling $668 million as of December 31, 2017, comprised of 41% in cash and short term deposit for $276 million and 59% in undrawn committed facility for approximately $392 million with local and international banks. Our strong cash position, coupled with a stable cash flow generation from new projects, which are now fully operational, will allow the company to fully honor its debt repayment program and any additional equity commitments. Moving on to slide 22."
1,"The composition of our loan book and the regional view are shown on slides 33 and 34, and we are seeing positive trends in several of our markets and verticals, most notably commercial real estate and construction and our national lending platforms. Our CRE and construction lenders saw a steady supply of deals in 2017, reviewing more than $5. 5 billion in loans year-to-date."
1,"The construction segment experienced healthy levels of demand, which is expected to continue. The retail business is stable as our customer base is primarily freestanding retail stores and not mall-based stores where most of the retail pressures have been concentrated so far. The industrial segment has begun to improve and trend in a more positive direction."
1,"The contribution of start-up and ramp-up at â‚¬190 million is slightly above forecast with 19 new projects coming on stream. Our backlog remains stable too at â‚¬2. 1 billion, in fact, thanks to the acceleration of new signings at the end of the year."
1,"The decrease from last year was driven by menu price increases, better management of paper and packaging inventories, and lower priced avocados. We expect relatively stable prices in 2018 including for avocados which along with the price increase should lower our food costs to the low to mid 33% range. California avocado growth should be on the upswing for their alternate-bearing crop this summer and we're fortunate that the recent wildfires in California are not expected to impact supply."
1,"The demand for EUV products was very strong in the quarter. Our growth rate was fairly similar sequentially and we expect this growth rate to remain steady for the second half of the year, even as we add capacity to meet increased demand. Silicon carbide was also strong in the quarter."
1,"The EBIT margin guidance includes the impact of our assumptions around the SpeediCath patent expiry and healthcare reforms in Greece as well as acquisitions. On our operating expenses, we expect broadly stable trends in 2017-2018. This year, we will invest up to 2% of sales enhancing initiatives."
1,"The facility will have an installed capacity of 25,000 tonnes per annum. Utilization levels at our sheeting and drapery and upholstery facilities remained stable during the quarter. We see the stability to continue in Q4 FY 2018 as well."
1,"The fees contributed by this line item end of quarter three was close to INR 43 crores, up from INR 18 crores at the end of last quarter. Final point I wanted to make is, what is the driver for the trade and cash management fees, which I think steady quarter-on-quarter growth and therefore, a rising contribution to our fees and commission line item on a quarterly basis, it's the growth in our non-funded exposure. Non-funded exposure trade related stood at INR 27,258 crores at the end of December 2017, up from INR 25,000 crore some in the previous quarter and up from INR 14,700 crore from this time last year."
1,"The financial results of this quarter are clearly disappointing. They mask all the great work we are doing of course to position our company for the future steady growth we expect. No doubt, it has been a challenging quarter for national television sales, but there are notable bright spots, such as subscriber revenues that were better than we anticipated."
1,"The first is, AntÃ³nio mentioned today, earlier on, the UK economy is very resilient. And going forward, while we are prepared for contingencies, our base plan and projections assume this performance continues with a steady increase in base rates to 1. 25% by the end of 2020, which I think I said earlier."
1,"The first phase was the new T-Mobile ONE and there was a lot of excitement in the community about, oh, hey, that's really going to increase ARPUs and we said no, wait. We're not done, you should not expect that's not the strategy that we're deploying because our strategy is to scale the business and of stable ARPU environment because that's going to unlock more value than monetizing additional revenue per subscriber. And when you look at the ARPU equation, there are things that are accretive to ARPU that we're dealing."
1,"The following assumptions are included in our guidance. Relatively stable market conditions and regulatory environment, positive revenue contribution from the acquisition of Zyga Technologies announced January 4, 2018, ongoing positive impact of efforts to reduce complexity and implement operational excellence and continued marketing of Map3 and minimal negative revenue impact related to our recent FDA warning letter. Our guidance is intended to be for the full year."
1,"The four strategic pillars supporting our 2018 guidance include execution under our new operating model, innovation and growth under our new strategy and business development team, and continued focus on deploying capital in a balanced and efficient way. So, at a high level, our guidance reflects our expectation of improving execution in key markets and our intensified commitment to advance long-term strategic opportunities in a relatively stable to modestly improving end market backdrop. So, with that, let me pass the baton to Tom, who's going to take a deeper dive into our Q4 segment results and the 2018 outlook."
1,"The funnel for our growth and innovation services is getting stronger as our sales teams gets better at positioning our services, and the base of our customers who are willing to refer us is growing. You will also see how this is translating into a steady improvement in our product penetration rates. Coming to the financial results that we just announced, despite industry headwinds data business has delivered healthy growth."
1,"The Generation segment's revenue from sales of heat fell by 5% year-on-year to PLN 438 million, on a 6% decrease in sales volumes. Revenue from sales of electricity generated by the segment's own sources remained relatively stable at the level of PLN 204 million, with sales volumes rising by 6%. A considerable decrease in operating expenses listed the segment's EBITDA by PLN 42 million to PLN 241 million."
1,"The government is implementing fee indexation progressively for GP services over the coming years. I guess just a final point on SCS; we now have a strong and stable management team in place, headed up by our relatively new CEO, Dr. Ged Foley."
1,"The group's gross NPE ratio has come down to 10. 2% in the fourth Q 2017, while the coverage ratio was stable at 56. 2%."
1,"The growth outlook for 2018 is very favorable, better than it has been for almost a decade. We expect national cement consumption in our main markets to be from stable to growing during 2018, and conservatively anticipate both our consolidated cement and aggregate volumes to grow by 2% while our ready-mix volumes should grow by 4%. Regarding our cost of energy on a per-ton-of-cement-produced basis, we expect a 4% increase from last year's levels."
1,"The improved trends to service revenues are attributed to several factors, including increased access revenues and new account formation. Our postpaid phone base migrations to unsubsidized service pricing are progressing and now represent approximately 80% of our postpaid phone base, approaching steady-state as most of our business customers remain on subsidized plans. In the fourth quarter, equipment revenue increased to $6."
1,"The increase in classified loans was mostly due to one large commercial loan relationship that was downgraded during the quarter. Delinquency trends were stable during the fourth quarter as approximately 98. 6% of the portfolio was considered current at December 31, 2017 compared to 98."
1,The increase in interest income of $18 million for the six-month period was offset by approximately the same amount of increase in adjusted interest expense. The increase in our interest income was driven by a $892 million or 4% increase in our average interest earning assets as our average yield on these assets remained relatively stable. The increase on our adjusted interest expense is mainly attributable to the increase in the cost of our short-term borrowings and other variable rate obligations tied to LIBOR.
1,"The increase in the same-property adjusted NOI in Q4 2017 was primarily due to higher preferred accommodation and ancillary services revenues and lower utility expenses, partially offset by higher repairs and maintenance and other inflationary cost increases. We expect continuing stable performance and high occupancy in our LTC portfolio in 2018. I will now turn the call back to Brent to wrap up."
1,"The industry dynamics that we currently operate in give us the confidence that we'll be able to optimally utilize the additional capacity within three quarters to four quarters of it being operational. I would also wish to inform you that the company has received from CRISIL rating agency a credit rating of A2+ for our export funding, and A- stable for term loans. We believe this will help us in streamlining our interest costs going forward."
1,"The last year has been a period of transition and transformation. We executed on our plan to simplify our portfolio and add more stable cash flows with downstream-facing assets. We are just beginning to see the result of this, and we expect to continue on this positive trajectory through 2019 and beyond."
1,"The majority of funding came from customer deposit at 78% of total funding. With a relatively more stable funding profile our customer deposits, our average Singapore dollar LCR and all-currency LCR remained high at 254% and 159%, respectively. Moving on to slide 27, on our capital position, you can see that, for the quarter, our capital position improved further."
1,"The margin decrease year-over-year was primarily driven by FX headwinds in some of the countries in which we operate, combined with some wage inflation. Sequentially, our adjusted gross margin was stable compared to Q3, despite the usual window for sale increases during the last quarter of the year. We finished the quarter and the year with 6,753 Globers, 6,279 of which were IT professionals."
1,"The markets budgeted in the 2% to 5% growth range represent nearly 90% of our same property pool and 11 of our 13 markets received a letter grade of B or higher this year. Our top ranking for 2018 goes to Southern California, which we rate as an A with a stable outlook. Our Southern California portfolio has been a strong performer, averaging 5."
1,"The markets in which we make residential construction loans are either undersupplied or in balance, resulting in timely absorption and manageable levels of completed inventory. As I said at the outset of my remarks, it was a stable year for credit at Banner, which further solidified the moderate risk profile of our loan portfolios and positions us well for the future. With that, I'll turn the stage over to Lloyd for his comments."
1,"The new Colliers Proptech Accelerator powered by Techstars will allow us to source, shape and invest in new technology solutions that meet our criteria across the entire real estate value chain. So with a strong balance sheet and ample capacity to fund our continued growth, a significant acquisition in Finland at the start of the year, and stable market conditions for the foreseeable future, we are optimistic 2018 will be another year of excellent performance for our company. Now let me turn things over to John, and once he's completed, we'll open things up for questions."
1,"The next phase to 2020 is all about performance, delivery and financial discipline, as we marry customer-led gross margin growth with continuing to drive material levels of cost efficiency, while maintaining capital discipline and a strong balance sheet. It is this combination and our track record of efficiency and financial discipline to-date which gives us confidence to deal with the uncertainties posed by any default tariff cap in the UK and to indicate a stable dividend outlook within defined boundary conditions. It is undeniable that at this moment Centrica faces a higher level of external uncertainty."
1,"The only other factor that I think will contribute to some volatility in the first half of this year will be the   because this is   the market story is we well, well within the boundaries of natural variation of volatility in our portfolio and we have several offsetting components of our portfolio. The benefit of which has seen in our stable operating performance. The only other component is the start-up associated with our brand renovation and re-launch which I described and discussed a moment earlier."
1,The operating profit came in higher by 5% at INR 107 crores. Our flavors division reported a stable revenue performance during the period under review. Domestic segment grew 10% while overseas business reported de-growth of 12% during the nine months FY 2018.
1,"The other topic I want to discuss is our outlook for Shipbuilding. When we developed our Path to 2020 strategy three years ago, the revenue outlook was stable, based on Congress providing funding to support the Navy's 308-ship plan of record. Since that time, the new National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy have re-examined the perspective composition and lethality of the future force."
1,"The outperformance of our results in this submarket compared to the rig count speaks to our continued success, increasing our market share in North America. The growth in oil and gas revenues both sequentially and year-over-year has been driven by steady improvements in rental and replacement activity at our Amega West business. While activity remains more heavily weighted on the rental side, we are beginning to see an uptick in the replacement orders."
1,"The outstanding share count at quarter end was 459 million shares and we had $943 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization which expires December 31, 2019. Turning to our outlook, we expect solid business performance in 2018 with minimal net impact from foreign exchange and stable pricing. As a result, revenue growth is expected to be in a range of a low to mid single-digit increase this year, both on a reported and constant currency basis."
1,"The overall company performance this past year further validates our long-term strategy and continues our progress to grow profitably and diversify the business in order to create meaningful and sustainable shareholder value. With the Supreme acquisition, we've taken another step change in the diversification of the company to further enhance margins, ensure a more stable earnings stream and leverage our existing assets including our strong balance sheet to take advantage of the macro growth trends such as home delivery and urbanization, which are driving growth of the Final Mile market. Before I hand off to Brent, let me share with you our views regarding prospects for the current year."
1,"The performance in these areas provided more evidence to us that we've made the right decision to focus Midland around our core community banking and wealth management businesses. These are more stable businesses with consistent growth trajectories that we believe will reduce the volatility that we've seen in our recent financial performance. Ultimately, we believe we're on the right path to a business mix that will enhance the value of the company for our shareholders in the years ahead."
1,"The primary driver of the improvement was lower obsolescence charges, offset partially by changes in geographic mix. Pricing continues to remain relatively steady across both our product lines and geographies. Our adjusted EBITDA loss was approximately $300,000 compared to a $1."
1,"The proceeds of our capital recycling program continuously reinvested to improve earnings, quality of core stabilized assets to fund investment upside in core+ assets, improve active assets and to grow our funds management platform. The investments we've made over the last few years including managing people, processes, our platform and sustainability has led Cromwell on a strong position to generate sustainable organic growth from a stable base with strong predictable cash flow. The core stabilized portfolio will deliver NOI growth."
1,"The projects typically have been awarded for longer term, so we typically have a longer visibility on these projects and we've not seen anything that has made it more volatile up or down. So, I would say it's one of our more stable predictable areas, of course, with a lot of commentary coming from many different areas. It's an area that we've looked at quite closely."
1,"The provision was up $11 million compared to a relatively low level in the third quarter and down $19 million versus a year ago, reflecting an improvement in overall credit quality. Lastly our allowance to total loans and leases ratio was relatively stable at 1. 12% and our NPL coverage ratio improved to 142% from 131% in the third quarter and 118% in the year-ago quarter."
1,"The quarter also reflects higher expenses related to acquisitions completed in 2017 as well as higher incentives that are tied to our strong capital markets production. On our balance sheet, we continue to grow stable, low-cost deposits. Average loans declined this quarter, which was not consistent with our expectation, driven primarily by our commercial real estate business, where we saw higher debt placements, which contributed to our record investment banking fees, as well as elevated loan paydowns."
1,"The Rail Group's results were hampered by a lower lease rates and some higher expenses for interest and depreciation year-over-year. Our Grain business results are improving and underlying Grain fundamentals are stable with good grain ownership income opportunities. As we expected, however, large global 2017 corn and soybean harvests have kept world supply and carry outs into 2018 for corn, soybeans and wheat, quite large which have kept both prices and market volatility low."
1,"The rail market brought in sustained growth with some new projects across all zones. As for electric vehicles, the business was stable after a freeze on incentives in China, which hurt our sales at the beginning of the year. And in process industries sales were buoyant driven by the generally good economy and the recovery for the process industry overall."
1,"The relatively modest decrease in industry volume largely reflected the improving economic environment across most markets. Our total regional market share in 2017 was stable, reflecting a gain from HEETS, which reached a share of 0. 3% for the year and 0."
1,"The run rate should be stable for a year now, because we started some bigger ticket size projects over the last four months..."
1,"The safety of our employees and the communities we serve continues to be our top priority. Our reportable and serious injury ratios are stable, although we are not satisfied without continuous improvement in this area. We achieved our lowest train accident frequency on record beating last year's record level."
1,"The setup for North America Commercial and Residential HVAC markets looks positive and we're expecting a mid-single digit growth in these core markets. In North America, approximately half of our Commercial business is services and parts where we had good growth throughout 2017 and where the nature of the business generally tends to provide a more stable and recurring annuity stream, than put in place equipment which would be associated with things like new building starts. We've also had strong demand for upgrades to connected buildings and for energy retrofits to capture the energy efficiency savings from new equipment, controls and diagnostics."
1,"The statutory tax rate for 2018 remains essentially unchanged at 27%. Our effective tax rate for accounting purposes is also projected to be stable in 2018 at approximately 25%, reflecting a similar level of year-over-year tax adjustments of $0. 07 per share."
1,"The strong net new money inflow reflects the geographic diversity of our franchise. It comes from Asia and other emerging economies, but it also comes from more stable European markets such as Monaco, our growing domestic business in Germany, and notably also from the UK where we have expanded our presence last year. Looking at the capital ratios, they are very strong."
1,"The third quarter was also favorably impacted by the $58 million in legal accrual reversals. Expenses were stable relative to 2016 as a result of our continued expense management efforts, including continued reductions in our branch network and investments in self-serve channels, including mobile. Provision expense increased $196 million relative to 2016, as a result of the reserve build associated with the hurricanes, in addition to strong loan growth."
1,"The top line was approximately CHF 40 million additional sales generated last year and the cost impact very much depends on the gradient of the metal price development over the year. And since as you've said, we had last year quite a constant growth for the first four months of the year than we had a stable situation around the mid-year, where we also said that currently we're going to see flat price development, we've seen once again an increase of the prices in the last four months of the year. So, that's the reason why the MTZ delay cost impact has been high and that's the reason why we distinguished between the two effects."
1,"The tower business continues to be extremely attractive and we're pleased to be a leader in our industry. In 2017, we saw steady activity across all of our markets and we executed extremely well. We were able to grow our portfolio, shrink our outstanding share count, manage our financing costs and expand our already industry-leading operating margins."
1,"The volume is our friend as it is any manufacturing company's friend. And as a result, our margins remain stable in the mid-60s and we expect to be able to double our operating profit by 2022. So we'd been in the mid-20s now."
1,"The year-end dividend for FY 2017 was increased by Â¥2 to make the annual dividend as Â¥27. Our board of directors set the dividend policy for FY 2018 to pay Â¥30 therefore we intend to continue stable dividend payment like Â¥25 in 2016, Â¥27 in 2017 and Â¥30 in 2018. Now let me briefly explain about appendix."
1,"The year-over-year income growth primarily reflected higher average assets, while the sequential increase reflected growth in our average assets and higher portfolio yield. For 2018, we expect yield to remain relatively stable around fourth quarter levels. Modest fluctuations may occur from quarter-to-quarter depending on product mix, pricing and day count."
1,There are signs that things are stabilizing like sequentially the revenues are stabilizing. Your sense around is this a new stable position or could you grow mobile broadband towards the back-end of this year?
1,"There continue to be some modest pressures on non-performing and criticized loans, but there are no apparent pressures on particular industries or geographies. Our outlook for credit losses remains relatively stable. Net charge-offs amounted to just 16 basis points last year, following 18 basis points in 2016, and 19 basis points in each of 2014 and 2015, all of which are roughly half our long-term average of 35 basis points."
1,"There continues to be a general sense of optimism in the market as jobs have been created across the country and wages have generally been moving higher. The low unemployment rate and the labor shortage has been translating into wage growth and the attitude of our customers continues to confirm the same sense that we have as business operators, and that is that the economic environment is generally strong and stable and improving. Accordingly, we've seen new orders, home deliveries and margins continue to be at least in line with or above our expectations."
1,"There has been little change to our capital position and net tangible assets continue to increase. Our debt-to-capital ratio remains low and stable with goodwill supported by solid income flow in each of the three business lines. On this next slide, I will cover our return and dividend metrics."
1,"There is nothing relevant, I mean, in the fourth quarter rather than the decrease of the â‚¬40 million from the cat losses and also the good performance at Solunion and the agreement for the surety business, which contributed extraordinary income of â‚¬5 million. But in general, I mean the fourth quarter was quite steady in terms of losses and weather was quite benign both in the U. S."
1,"There was strong demand across all therapeutic indications. In Eye Care, sales for RESTASIS and our glaucoma business were both relatively stable, and OZURDEX was up 17%. In GI, LINZESS sales were up 12% versus prior year, and VIBERZI sales also saw solid growth at 13% versus prior year."
1,"Therefore, for the remaining portfolio of over $32 billion in loans, there are only $17 million in non-accrual loans or just 5 basis points, demonstrating again the pristine quality of our portfolio. Our past-due loans remained stable with 30 to 89-day past due loans decreasing $3 million to $42 million, while 90-day plus increased slightly by $1 million to $6 million. The provision for loan losses for the 2017 fourth quarter was $41."
1,"There's not   doesn't seem to be much change in the market. Our win rates seem to be steady, and our influence in the market seems to be pretty consistent."
1,"These are the types of opportunities that we continue to pursue throughout our organization, and we expect them to continue to play an important role in supporting Buckeye's future growth. Before I hand the call over to Keith, I would like to reiterate that our portfolio, Domestic Pipelines & Terminals assets continue to deliver steady, reliable return to the company and unitholders. Thanks to our fee-based assets and consistent cash flows."
1,"These being below corporate average gross margin, but a lot less price sensitive. The SSD solutions growing sequentially for a couple of quarters, Q2, Q3, and stabilizing stable growth in Q4 versus our client SSD declining for several consecutive quarters and rebounding only in Q4. So, this led to our product mix mixing towards our lower gross margin away from our higher gross margin leading to some pressure on our gross margin line."
1,"These characteristics include maintaining one of the highest levels of management ownership in the industry of 25%. A strong and growing dividend, strong return on equity, ample low-cost available and long-term liquidity with which to grow our current asset base, solid earnings per share and NII yield with substantial growth potential, steady high-quality expansion of assets under management and attractive risk profile with protection against potential interest rate risk. Our high credit quality portfolio contains minimal exposure to cyclical industries including the oil and gas industry."
1,"These new potential projects represent more than $50 million in incremental annual revenue opportunity. In terms of our youth services business, we continued to experience stable utilization rates across our facilities. Our youth segment has been stable for the past couple of years after our team undertook a number of consolidation and marketing initiatives."
1,"These opportunities are low-risk, high productivity wells in prolific fields that can deliver an average rate of return of 85% or better with very competitive finding and development costs. Our Gulf of Mexico program delivers consistent stable oil production. And over the next three years, we expect production to be flat with cumulative free cash flow generation exceeding $4 billion at $60 oil."
1,"These percentages decreased from the prior quarter as one portfolio and company investment was liquidated at a value consistent with its mark at September 30. Turning to slide 10, the percentage of investments risk-rated at 5 or 4, our two highest categories, remained stable quarter-over-quarter and continues to represent over 85% of the portfolio. As a reminder, independent valuation firms continue to value approximately 25% of our investments each quarter."
1,"These results further reflect the trends I mentioned on the previous slide. We've driven consistent profitability improvement through growing net interest revenue, stable credit quality and continued declines in our operating expenses. These results reflect a compound operating EPS growth of 12% over the past four years, culminating with the record annual net income for our company in 2017."
1,"These segments currently represent approximately half of our Semiconductor revenue. The balance of our Semiconductor business remained strong, but relatively flat quarter-to-quarter as our cryo vacuum business and Polycold chiller business remains robust, that is near record levels, and product lines that include 200-millimeter products, load ports RFID and other automation products were also steady and profitable. Looking into the March quarter, we anticipate the most significant part of our Semiconductor revenue growth will again come from our three key growth drivers, and demand for our legacy leadership products will stay healthy with the potential for some upside."
1,"These statistics speak to our deep customer relationship that has been the bedrock of the Constellation business. We continue to see stable unit margins with our C&I customers, and our aggressive cost management is helping to further support operating margins. And now I'd like to turn it over to Jack to walk through some of the numbers."
1,"These targets assume more normalized weather compared to the previous two years as does our cat load assumption of 6 to 7 points. From a growth perspective, we anticipate PIF will be generally flat in 2018, despite the rate actions we've taken to improve in profitability, we're pleased that our retention levels and overall market share is stable. We are seeing new business growth emerged in geographies that meet P&C profitability targets and as we continue to take steps to address other less profitable market we would expect our new business growth rate to accelerate over time."
1,"These two contracts will add about 28,000 Platinum ounces per year, increasing our process capacity utilization and equally lowering our costs. We enjoyed stable performance from our smelter complex in financial year 2017. We have seen a step change in the reliability of these furnaces."
1,"They have a broad product portfolio, including significant emphasis and capability in prepared foods that is supported by value-added innovation capabilities. We continue to be very excited about the potential of our opportunities in our new UK and Continental Europe operations, because it creates a stronger, more diverse and much more stable global chicken and chicken-based prepared foods leader in Pilgrim's. The acquisition aligns well with our strategic priorities, as we continue expanding our geographical and brand footprint and extending our global poultry leadership position in attracted new markets while providing us a solid platform in the region for future growth."
1,"They look fabulous. It's a good brand for us to have in our stable as it relates to giving us the opportunity to go into other customers and other channels and address some of the issues and conflicts that sometimes can arise with that. So, it fits nicely and played, I would say, a strong role in our ability to get this business together with the broad offering that we can offer and putting to use the structural competitive advantage that we have in our cabinet business to come in at a very attractive price point."
1,"They were roughly $24 million in 2017, will come down more in 2018. Our amortization related to GPI is going to stay roughly steady at about $40 million. What you will see over the next couple of years going forward is an increase in our transformation expenses, as we really start to double down on our supply chain footprint optimization."
1,"They've admitted difficulty in processing titles and it causes buildup of inventory in that one location. And you can see that impact when we're more efficient at processing titles and we can move the cars on a steady pace, our margins go up. And we've also   the other thing, Bob, I'd point out is we've seen strong average selling prices."
1,"This is Dave. Rig counts, as you know, remained stable in the mid-900s and with energy extraction at high levels, we could see the OCTG market demand continue with its steady recovery, which, of course, is good for the Tubular segment as well as our North American Flat-Rolled business via the hot-rolled coiled sales to customers. Of course, the way this works is when the hot-rolled coil increase cost to the Tubular business, they have to find offsets for that."
1,"This is Dugald River. Our Kinsevere operation in the DRC countries to deliver stable and consistent production with its third consecutive year over 80,000 tonnes of copper cathode. We have developed a strong operational track record since entering the DRC in 2012 and see the country as an attractive region for potential future growth."
1,"This is evident in the decrease in our group support service expenses highlighted in the yellow bar, which shows decreases in a range of expenses including administration, consulting fees, and incentive for reversals. Moving through the table; significant items in this half were material, comprising the booking of legal costs associated with the cross shareholding action, carried out by one of our subsidiaries, while underlying profits showed good growth over the first half FY 2017 and was steady on the second half FY 2017. The NPAT result was impacted by the significant item."
1,"This is just one of the many levers real estate ownership provides us, and as we've said many times before, this is one of the reasons we continue to purchase underperforming real estate. We continue to see a steady flow of acquisition opportunities across all our business segments. These potential transactions come from a variety of sources and different types of sellers, ranging from smaller operators and nonprofits that are exiting the business to large or regional operators that are selling non-core or turnaround assets."
1,"This is Nacho. In terms of International Banking, or on a quarter-over-quarter basis, our NIM was stable. And although there are many components that James says, and given the international franchise, really the main driver that is leading to some variation is the mix of commercial and retail growth, and year-over-year commercial has grown faster than retail."
1,"This is one early example of the capital commitment from our new sponsor to facilitate NYLD's future CAFD and dividend growth capabilities. Turning to page 7, in conclusion, our long-term business approach remains intact with diversification around different fuel types, technologies and locations, bringing a more stable CAFD generation and investment opportunities. We'll also maintain our financial discipline with a target payout ratio of 80% to 85%, our consistent BB/Ba2 targeted credit rating, long protractive cash flow, and NOL runway tenors and the optimization of project debt as a source of funding."
1,"This is reflected in our guidance for slightly negative cash for leasing spreads for the full year in 2018. On balance, however, we continue to see gradual improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio driven by modest market rent growth and steady progress on cycling through peak vintage lease expiration. In terms of our fourth quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy slipped 60 basis points sequentially to 90."
1,"This is the opportunity, the prize that we've all had our eyes on for the last five or six years or so. We're excited about the prospects of working with the CDM management, with the CDM employee complement, to take the combined USA and CDM to yet again another level to continue our history and track record of providing exemplary levels of customer service in the field to our long-term base of steady customers and for working safely and getting everybody back home at night. So we appreciate everybody's continued interest."
1,"This is, of course, partly due to our acquisition of Plenti, but also without that, we are better off by our consumer ARPU increases. In Q4, consumer churn came as low as 16%, and this is now seven quarters in a row where we have been able to grow our total gross profit on an organic basis after a number of years with steady declines. We expect overall to be able to continue this development in 2018 where we also welcome almost 100,000 public customers and where Plenti customers have now been migrated to TDC's network."
1,This modest decline in development starts from 2017 is largely due to beginning 2018 with a significant backlog of development projects currently under construction as well as continuing a disciplined approach to managing lease-up risk and maintaining our development pipeline at a healthy level pre-leasing. Our pipeline of build-to-suit prospects continues to remain steady.
1,"This outperformance, coupled with multiple productivity initiatives, which I will discuss in a moment, allowed us to make important investments in our business to position us well for 2018. Specifically, we were able to maintain stable benefits for our members, which resulted in strong AEP growth for our Medicare franchise in the face of significant headwinds, in particular, the return of the nondeductible health insurance fee in 2018. Our Retail segment significantly outperformed our initial expectations for 2017, with individual Medicare Advantage pre-tax margins finishing the year above the high end of our 4."
1,"This represents a 17% organic growth rate when taking the midpoint of the guidance range. Based on the committed implementation schedules of bookings in December 31, 2017 backlog, including a record number of multimillion dollar fourth quarter deals and to a lesser extent, the new products revenue from XR2 and IVX, we anticipate a steady quarterly revenue ramp throughout the year in 2018. It's important to note that the fourth quarter revenue any given year typically includes some seasonality."
1,"This should get us down to 5. 5 times debt-to-EBITDA by the end of the year and position us well with the rating agencies, as we advance discussions around our position as the most stable and defensive healthcare REIT in the sector. I will now turn it back to Scott for final remarks."
1,"This team has been transitioning day-to-day responsibilities from our partners and we expect that they will be fully independent in the very near future. Unfortunately, the performance of the Powerband business has not improved as we had expected in our discussions last call, the business continues to face macro-related challenges, including raw material prices, which have been more stable recently than in the first half of 2017, but continues to rise with minimal relief to pass on these increases. Despite these challenges, the business has remained cash flow positive and we've seen our competitive position in North American tape market improved nicely as a result of the additional revenue opportunities created by the Powerband acquisition so far."
1,"This transaction was obviously vital to our transformation. One of the key to this deal was converting one of our more volatile income streams, company-operated fuel margins to a 15-year take-or-pay contract, which is now one of our most stable income streams. Step two was fixing our capital structure."
1,"This was led by Los Angeles where we have our largest concentration of capital, followed by San Diego and Boston. Our steady performers, which had revenue growth of 2. 5% to 3%, were Atlanta, Chicago and the Bay Area with revenue growth of 1% to 1."
1,"This will be even more important in 2018, given the tighter reserved margins expected in ERCOT, increasing the probability of scarcity events. In addition, strong commercial availability supports Vistra's ability to opportunistically hedge our assets, which as you know, is critical to our ability to deliver a more stable and higher earnings profile in volatile power price environments. For the full year of 2017, Luminant's commercial operations team realized prices that were nearly 44% higher than settled prices."
1,"Those on drug received two weeks of a 40 milligram dose, followed by two weeks of an 80 milligram dose. Study participants were allowed to be on stable antipsychotic treatments, stable anti-Parkinson's disease treatments, and stable background cholinesterase inhibitor therapy for at least four weeks prior to screening. The primary endpoint of the study was safety, including an assessment of symptoms as measured by the change in UPDRS scores."
1,"Those projects all stayed well on track and within our budgeted projections. Graham will talk to our reserve additions where we managed to offset the vast majority of depletion and keep our mineral inventory steady despite the strong production performance, which depletes ounces. Notable here is our maiden attributable reserve of 1."
1,"Those were good. We see good demand out in the marketplace, as you can tell by our fourth quarter pricing has remained relatively stable. So, I think the first quarter outlook is favorable."
1,"To be clear, the volatility in our CCS business is a result of some challenging markets, but we continue to win new programs from these OEMs who entrust Celestica to support some of the most critical electronic infrastructure in the world. In addition to these wins, we are seeing continued and steady growth in our JDM business. In 2017, our JDM business represented 10% of our CCS sales, with revenue growing 12% compared to 2016."
1,"To begin, we generated revenue of $6. 4 million in 2017 in Europe, as we executed our controlled launch, followed by our steady expansion into additional countries. We scaled throughout the year and achieved revenue of just under $3 million in the fourth quarter."
1,"To give consumers the ability to customize their entertainment experience with things like optional add-on packages, optional cloud DVR and the option to get free broadcast locals with an antenna, even the option to come in and out of the service. So throughout 2017, we've seen steady improvements in our stability of the platform. This is translating to more engaged subscribers watching 27% more Sling per day."
1,"To take these revenue trends and provide you with a preview of 2017, on a preliminary basis, the effect of the increases in revenue resulting from the $10 million in disallowed sales improvement and same clinic growth have been offset by revenue declines in our Products & Services segment, resulting in 2017 revenues that we anticipate will generally be in the same range as of those of 2016. In reviewing our operating expense trends, our cost of materials as a percentage of net revenue has remained relatively stable. It's trended at or just under 32% of net revenue from 2014 through 2016."
1,"Today, as we deliver wings, we do. But as we get out of the summer timeframe, that's going to sunset, and we'll be delivering   the supply chain will catch up, any residual changes that came out of the flight test program, our ground test program, producibility changes, make things easier to build as those are all completed, then the design configuration is stable, supply chain catches up, and you don't have any traveled work. And this is very typical for new programs."
1,"Together our combined scale, diversity and expertise we believe will be even better positioned to continue this momentum. Looking at slide 17, for both SJW Group and Connecticut Water, a stable and growing dividend has been an important part of our total shareholder return. In fact, at Connecticut Water, we have paid quarterly dividends for 62 years since our founding in 1956 without interruption or reduction and we've increased dividend payments in each of the past 48 years."
1,"Together with dividend payments, we returned $446 million to shareholders during 2017, representing 65% of our non-GAAP net income in the period. In addition to continuing our regular stock buyback activity with intention of maintaining a stable share count, we anticipate using after-tax proceeds of the sale of the multimedia and PR businesses to repurchase additional shares which is expected to lower our share count modestly and largely offset the EPS impact of the elimination of the annualized net income associated with the divested businesses. As of December 31, 2017, there is $226 million remaining under the board-authorized share repurchase program, and our Board of Directors recently approved an increase to our share repurchase authorization of an additional $500 million."
1,"Together, these adversely impacted earnings by AUD 3 million. Pleasingly, our contract portfolio has been stable, supported by strategic contract extensions undertaken in the prior year. As previously signaled, this impacted price by approximately AUD 2 million."
1,"Toshiya, let me start and then I'll hand it over to Rafael. And I think when you look at inventory, I'll start with inventory in the channel, it remains steady at about four weeks. I'll point out to those that aren't as familiar with us, that's structurally lower than many of our peers will run because of consignment programs."
1,"Turn to slide 5, to let me briefly outline our key results. We delivered a steady financial performance in 2017, despite market headwinds and the dampening effect of our massive transformation efforts. For the full year, total orders were steady with base orders up 5%."
1,"Turning to slide 10, we also generated strong adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO growth in 2017 driven by the 15% top line growth and diligent management of operating expenses, interest costs and maintenance CapEx. Our adjusted EBITDA grew by more than 15%, with our adjusted EBITDA margin holding steady at 61. 4%."
1,"Turning to slide 27. Our pipeline is among the best in the gold sector in terms of depth and the capital efficiency, and it gives us the means to maintain steady production while growing our margins and our reserves. Projects included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here."
1,"Turning to the following slide, the tables on the top provide a summary of our quarterly distributions and return on equity over the past five quarters. Our regular quarterly distributions have remained stable at $0. 32 a share, which is consistent with our net investment income per share when excluding the accrual for the capital gain incentive fee."
1,"Turning to Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy, adjusted global sales were $540 million, up 22% on an underlying basis over the prior year including the adjustment for the consumption of stocking inventory in Germany. Double-digit TAVR sales growth across all regions was driven by continued strong therapy adoption and our average selling price remains stable overall. In the U."
1,"Ultimately, we produce power to serve our customers and our communities. Our customer numbers increased again this year, with stable performance under challenging conditions in Australia combined with the steady increase in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, we continue to maintain first class reliability of our electricity supply and even with the extreme weather events of 2017, which saw two very severe typhoons within five days of each other, our customers experienced only minor outages in a few areas and only a slight impact to our overall reliability statistics."
1,"Used car values have strengthened, however, remains to be seen how long that will continue. Portfolio performance was consistent with expectations for the year, and our strong and stable historical performance with normal seasonal trends. We expect a decline in national new car sales in 2018, but we do not believe it will be material enough to significantly impact our market areas."
1,"Very good, thanks. And then, the second part of the question, regarding your cash position right now is looking as stable as it has been in a very long time. As you look at the product innovation plan, how does the $10 million play into that?"
1,"We achieved our objective of delivering positive operating leverage, while lowering the risk profile of our company and increasing regulatory capital levels from last year. Relative to last year's fourth quarter, our adjusted net interest margin was up 19 basis points; adjusted NII was up 7%; non-interest expenses were flat; total charge-offs remained stable; NPAs were down 34%; and the criticized asset ratio declined 70 basis points. These positive results were accompanied by a 22 basis point increase in our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio; an 8% reduction in shares outstanding."
1,"We add to that the not only the $42 billion that's available to us, but when you're generating upwards to $10 billion annually of free cash flow, it doesn't stop there. So very strong position in terms of our financial flexibility, very stable profile in terms of cash flow generation, which is very exciting for us and we believe for our investor base. How do we intend to deploy?"
1,"We also had very good growth in our other two Neurotech business. Our CMS business had double-digit growth, and that's been a fantastic smaller business for us, but really steady performer. And our neuro-powered instruments, we've launched the signature power drills that are just performing exceptionally well."
1,"We also have a pristine balance sheet, which has been used in the past and we will continue to use in the future as we evolve the capital allocation policy. Our governance now is stable and with that, we now look at our strategic priorities that we lay out at the April Investor Day. That's what I wanted to share with you from our call today."
1,"We also saw strong underlying growth in our materials handling and sustainability sectors, favorably impacted by project timing. Our contract portfolio has been stable, supported by strategic contract extensions undertaken in the prior year. As previously signaled, our price was adversely impacted by AUD 4 million in the period because of these extensions."
1,We anticipate a fairly stable net interest margin. We expect relatively steady gain on loan sale income with no meaningful impact in the quarter from the previously noted expansion of our direct-to-consumer mortgage team. We anticipate the net return on MSRs will approximate 5% to 7% before transaction costs from the closing of MSR sales.
1,"We anticipate legislative efforts to increase Missouri's motor fuel taxes will be introduced in the near future. On balance, we see Missouri private as remaining stable, while Missouri public could accelerate if the new motor fuel tax is implemented. Turning to slides 21 and 22 for a discussion of our Cement segment, which had a record year in 2017."
1,"We anticipate moderately higher investment income and we expect our ROE to be in the range of 12% to 13% in 2018. Based on these objectives, our proven business model and a stable macroeconomic environment, 2018 should be another strong year. And I'll turn the call back to Stuart to conclude our prepared remarks."
1,"We are also moving from guiding mobile service revenue to guiding total revenue and expectation of the increasing relevance of device-based propositions, consumer IoT, and cross and upselling mechanisms to our P&L. As such, we expect revenue declining regulatory effects to remain broadly stable year on year as our attractive market propositions will help us counteract remaining headwinds from mix shift, legacy-based and OTT effects. OIBDA adjusted for exceptional effects and excluding regulatory effects is expected to be flat to slightly positive in 2018 with remaining integration synergies balancing commercial and transformation investment necessary to partake in market growth opportunities in Germany."
1,"We are also very pleased to see yesterday's announcement by S&P that has upgraded its outlook for Gibson's from   to positive on the back of our infrastructure focused strategy. We are also encouraged by S&P's upside scenario under which our credit rated could be upgraded as we continue to deliver on our strategy in terms of executing our divestitures and securing organic growth that increases our weighting towards take-or-pay and stable fee based cash flows. Looking ahead to our first-quarter results, we want to remind everyone that we will be early adopting IFRS 16 as we had previously indicated."
1,"We are benefiting from a very positive momentum from a positive client effect and so on. We are not expecting over the short-term to have here increasing prices of commissions, but we do expect that with the progressive involvement of clients and with the benefit of our customer franchise, we have here a steady growth in our commissions, not at the high level. So we are speaking low-single digits, but we're expecting our recurring commissions to continue to evolve positively."
1,"We are continuing to try to build our top line revenue while being careful with respect to managing our expenditures. Our strategy to build the company is to create a portfolio of generic products designed to provide cash flow, and a stable base through development of more advanced products under the 505(b)(2) pathway. We feel we are making good progress along this plan."
1,We are delighted with the marked improvement in our ROE of up to 20% for PBB Group. This slide shows our consistent and steady improvement in headline earnings from ZAR 3. 9 billion in 2009 to over ZAR 14 billion in 2017.
1,"We are full of confidence for our future developments. Based on the changing situation and our reality, as well as the thorough analysis by the board, PetroChina will stand firm for steady development and take it as a guideline for leading our overall work, which shall be insisted and constantly enriched in the long run. Steady development policy in the new era are full implementation of new development concept, give overall planning of the current and the long-term, as well scale and efficiencies so as to realize higher quality development."
1,"We are getting $700 million from the Allergan settlement and we have strong organic cash flow. And we have also renegotiated our covenants in order to make sure that we have the needed financial flexibility to keep on reducing the debt in a very stable situation. With regards to the outlook for the full-year 2018, you will see here that we are expecting a significant reduction of revenues."
1,"We are happy to note that our HY figures reinforces the company's confidence in achieving a Y-on-Y growth of 30% in the domestic segment. Our export business has remained almost stable over the quarter both in terms of top line as well as bottom line. We are also working on creating a digital catalog of all our jewelry, so that our entire inventory is visible at all locations."
1,"We are investing in the business, but I would tell you that as a company, we still are focused on our efficiency. Our expense ratios have been stable to down over several years. We'll continue to focus there, but getting to your specific question, Mike, do you want to hit on that?"
1,"We are pleased with our financial performance during the year and the important operational milestones achieved across our diversified business units. Despite some headwinds associated with a rising interest rate environment, we believe our core operational cash flows remain stable and predictable. Our management team is focused on capturing new growth and we remain optimistic about the demand for our services."
1,"We are proud of the services and quality we provide to our clients and believe these efforts are being recognized. Moving on to Wunderlich Securities, the RIA/wealth management piece of our business which I'll only briefly touch on because it is a less volatile portion of our business that provides steady revenue and enhances our distribution. Assets under administration were approximately $8."
1,"We are using Medallia as our partner in the space. And we have just really started garnering the level of survey volume necessary for statistical relevance probably over the course of the last four to five months, and we have seen pretty significant growth in overall satisfaction since September of last year with a steady increase. And February is still ahead of January, although not fully baked, but feel really good about our current trends."
1,"We are very pleased with the excellent results generated in 2017. Assuming market conditions remain stable, our outlook for 2018 remains positive, and we believe we are well-positioned to continue to gain share and deliver strong operating results. I want to now ask the operator to open the line for questions."
1,"We are well-positioned to deliver consistent internal growth in earnings, cash flows and common stock dividends. With the headwinds in the markets recently, we also would like to highlight the stable long-term lease terms across much of our portfolio, driving visibility and resilience for our cash flows. With that, I will turn the call to Peter to give additional insights on our leasing."
1,"We attribute these gains to smart and strategic pricing, coupled with periodic implementation of our companywide sweeps program, which drives maximum audience engagement during peak national advertising period. Subscription revenue continues to be strong and stable performer and an opportunity for our company. Through sound pricing models and premium content, subscription revenue on a same property basis is down less than 1% since 2015."
1,"We believe that Rayonier is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these trends, given the geographic footprint of our portfolio and our proximity to ports, as well as our pure play focus on highly productive softwood timberlands. Within our Real Estate segment, we're also very encouraged by the strong pricing and steady demand for rural HBU parcels, as well as the traction we're realizing on our Wildlight development project north of Jacksonville. Together, these have translated into significant growth in our premium realizations over the last two years as we continue to find innovative ways to unlock HBU value within our portfolio."
1,We believe that there is an opportunity to exceed this estimate and are positioning ourselves to provide the capacity the industry needs to continue to meet demand levels. The powerboat marine business trends and anticipated trajectory for continued slow and steady growth fits well with our growing Marine platform and presence. The business model is similar to that of the RV model as both are based on and supported by the consumers' desire for an increasingly active family-based outdoor lifestyle.
1,We believe that we had a solid quarter both in terms of revenue. We've continued to keep our margins stable. We've invested in our business and would hope to see operating leverage over time.
1,"We believe this was a result of a series of improvements in our nonfood offer rather than an increase in underlying demand. Promo share in the fourth quarter was up slightly versus 2016, but the trend has been fairly stable with the same year-on-year increase in promo share in fourth quarter as in the third quarter. Then the second point, sales improvements in the fourth quarter were largely driven by our own efforts, not the economy."
1,"We built out our pipeline, enhanced our balance sheet to make that pipeline a reality. 2018 will be our year of transformation, with a steady stream of potential catalysts and milestones all as we continue to serve our community with the eteplirsen and advance our pipeline with a sense of urgency. We have much to do in 2018, but along the way, we will remain true to our mission of working to profoundly improve the lives of all patients with DMD."
1,"We continually focus on managing our entire discretionary expense base. While we would expect 2018 G&A expense to increase in stable markets, we would also expect compensation as a percent of revenue to decline, as a function of historical investment and increased scale in our business, resulting in continued upward bias in our operating margin. BlackRock's record 2017 financial performance reflects these historical investments and the strength of our globally integrated asset management and technology business."
1,"We continue securing new PPAs with mining, commercial and industrial customer to drive our growth in non-conventional renewable energy. Our long-term dollarized fuel price index PPAs with creditworthy Chilean off-takers, aligned with our efficient generation provide us with the stable cash flows and protect us from market volatility. We continue advancing with non-core asset sale efforts, including the ESSA transaction and the sale of a portion of our transmission assets to strengthen the company capital structure and fund our new growth projects."
1,"We continue to assume an impact of DKK 100 million in our guidance. Aside from the impact of the patent expiry and the healthcare reforms in Greece, our guidance assumes stable underlying growth trends across our regions. The guidance in Danish krone is significantly impacted by the depreciation of the U."
1,"We continue to be opportunistic there. I mean, I think how we would describe it is our North American OEMs have really stabilized after one or two large OEMs sort of exiting sort of the reuse piece, so I think we've got a steady North American base now at work and we continue to find niches internationally to get some modest growth in that division. So obviously, again, it's not a core focal point but we do understand that we don't have a lot of structural costs attached to that division, so any time we can get even modest growth that flow through to the bottom line is pretty important."
1,"We continue to benefit from our multimanager model, strong investment performance across strategies, and positive outcomes from our recent initiatives. And while there are many challenges facing active investment managers, which we're not immune to, we continue to generate strong growth in assets under management and stable overall fee rates, leading to favorable financial results and a positive outlook We are also seeing strong performance out of our Individual Annuities business. Although industry-wide sales have been under pressure, we've taken thoughtful steps to manage the business more efficiently and effectively."
1,"We continue to better systematize the integrated online and offline model, leveraging both social media and e-commerce platform, WeChat. Now by the way, each studio customers are called members and they represent a steady source of loyal brand fans. And the learnings that we're deriving from this unique model that we have in China has huge potential on how we are adapting and evolving our more traditional relationship based business models around the globe."
1,"We continue to execute on the themes that we outlined during that meeting with our focus on driving return to revenue growth, further reducing our OpEx, and increasing our free cash flow to pay down our debt. Driving a stable core business, accelerating our future growth while driving solid financial returns is not just our focus, it's job one. At no time in the history of the company have we had such an impressive portfolio of smart connectivity made easy solutions with broad market appeal that is aligned directly to our low power, small form factor and production price programmable logic strategy."
1,"We continue to expect our long-term model to be north of 90%. We will invest to build out our capabilities in capital and we're going to make those steady investments as we build out our IBM Cloud architecture and continue to leverage our outsourcing and services based business that need that fuel. And we're going to continue to drive and build out new capabilities through M&A and those new capabilities are going to be strategically aligned to that integrated model, that integrated portfolio, leveraging and building new capabilities of platforms, data, solution, and services."
1,"We continue to invest in multiple clinical trials for TEG, a multi-center BloodTrack study and KOL support from our Scientific Advisory Committee, as well as ongoing meaningful expansion of our sales force, including clinical representatives. Turning to our Blood Center business unit, for the past several quarters, the market has been relatively stable with moderating rates of decline in demand for blood products. In North America, volume declines appear consistent with our own estimates that have been validated by our customers, which is in the rate of decline of about 1% to 3% year-over-year."
1,"We continue to monitor the impacts of Customer Assistance Programs in areas impacted by natural events and growth in unsecured lending across our international footprint. However, our portfolio was stable and within our risk appetite. In Global Banking and Markets, we experienced reversals in both performing and impaired loans, largely related to improved credit quality in the energy sector."
1,"We continue to see increased activity for many of our defense customers. Our production activity related to our participation in the five-year $350 million Joint Strike Fighter Program that began in 2017 is now fully ramped and we expect production levels to remain fairly steady for the foreseeable future. Further, our entry into the aerospace market in India through our All Metal Services subsidiary is now expected to become operational by the end of the first quarter of 2018."
1,We continue to sit comfortably within our credit rating and debt covenant metrics. Our credit rating with Fitch remains at Triple B with a stable outlook. Thank you and I'll now hand back to Grant.
1,"We continue to stay focused on our bottom line numbers. On this front, we expanded our gross margin by keeping our ASP stable, continuing our cost reduction initiatives, and as a result increased profitability and cash flow generation. We continue to invest significant resources in growing our R&D and customer support infrastructure to address our expanding geographic footprint with new more cost-efficient products and even better services."
1,"We continue to view our Retail segment as a key driver of our business going forward. Turning to the Institutional segment, despite difficult market conditions, revenues and margins were relatively stable for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2017. Q4 ECN average daily volume of $11."
1,"We couldn't quite   because we were going to be launching them where you're having to take two 40s, we didn't want that price to be what we knew the 80 milligram price was going to be. So what we did after a year, after seeing how the demand looks like out in the marketplace, it's what we basically see in our clinical trials that we said that about a quarter of the patients are going to be stable on a 40 milligram and that's going to be an ideal dose to them. Now, we can start bringing up the 40 milligram to get it more close to the 80 milligram such that the prescribing of the physician will never be one where they're trying to trade off a small price difference between the 40 milligram and the 80 milligram."
1,"We delivered these results in a period of increased competition for many of our largest products, several of which have lost patent protection, and while continuing to invest heavily in the future of our business. Our steady progress through 2017 places us squarely on track to deliver against the long-term commitments we set several years ago for 2018. We enter 2018 in a strong position and confident about our long-term outlook."
1,"We developed new lines of high fiber Resistant Starch wheat, identified the phenotype for a Reduced Gluten wheat and advanced Extended Shelf Life wheat. We demonstrated steady advancement towards the commercialization of our high-value agricultural productivity traits, namely HB4 drought tolerant soybeans in Argentina, and field trials of Nitrogen Use Efficiency and Salinity Tolerance traits in India. We further enhanced our industry-leading development capabilities by adding one of the most advanced gene editing tools to our toolkit, CRISPR-Cas9."
1,"We did gain market share. Our acceptance rate by customers has remained steady. So if we approve them, they take our product at about the 81% level."
1,"We do a lot of large pumps in offshore upstream and that's been a difficult part of the OE business over the last several years, and we don't anticipate that recovering to any significance as we move through 2018 and even into 2019. Our aftermarket business in Power and Energy has remained pretty stable over the last two years. We did see some sequential progression in Q4 last year, which was encouraging."
1,"We do keep tracking our market share, and our market share has been pretty stable."
1,"We do not expect a material improvement in the overall market in 2018 and we'll further adjust cost as needed. Moving to Global Preneed, with $40 million of earnings in 2017, this segment continues to be a steady contributor to our business, supported by our alignment with market leaders, as well as expanded product offerings for the senior lifestyle market. We now protect around 1."
1,"We do not expect to breach any of the other covenants, if that was to become a risk, the recent equity financing has provided adequate liquidity that could be sent down to the Mexican subsidiary. Guidance will be provided at the time of the Q1 results to allow time to get all of our processes restarted and into steady state with full crews returned. As a final note, we have turned the corner VAT returns with $27 million returned in Q4 and another $6 million received today in Q1 with more promise in Q1 and Q2."
1,"We do not see it right now anything in a competitive environment that can   that should change it. But in general, we believe that the   as Guy mentioned, the changes that we'll do on the prices will be all through the year, and whatever is already taken into account into Q1 is already reflected in our stable gross margin expectation."
1,"We do them every one year to two years and the last two times that we have executed a price trial, the math said that we should not change our price. So our prices have been steady on the retail front for the last three years."
1,"We don't   that doesn't ebb and flow like it does maybe in multifamily based on incentives. Our business is pretty steady as it relates to the cost to put these tenants in, as it relates to what we're willing to give and what they want. Certain tenants cost more than others, and generally we're all about what our return on that cost is."
1,"We don't anticipate any more right now. But the fact that we had to add one a couple of quarters ago, indicates that there's a lot of   and when we add a team, it's because our banks are acquiring other banks and so we end up doing the conversion work and so that pace is continuing pretty steady."
1,"We don't expect it to have a material impact to our business, but something it could. So we're being, I believe, prudent in our kind of stable, flattish, landscape for Telco. Over the next couple of years, those things I just mentioned could be growth drivers and we'll have to see."
1,"We don't have that dynamic. And so, we would expect this type of steady run rate improvement, provided of course tax rates remain the same both in the U. S."
1,"We don't know what's happening with oil and what does it mean for freight and warehousing. So I would say we feel confident about the current guides of $200 million to $250 million and that internal forecast has now been stable for several weeks or months, but I would be lying to you if I wouldn't say there's uncertainty on the raw material side because we just see the inflation trends creeping in on many parts of our value chain."
1,"We don't necessarily try to time it, and what Bhansali does is something that we do not want to speculate, what they buy or how they setup the contracts. Like I said earlier, we believe in the steady supplies with our customers, and in the longer-run, these things even out yeah, that's our strong belief of the company. And not just INEOS Styrolution India, but globally we are leading this business for a good 30, 40 years, and have a global   how do you say experience in different markets, so we know how it plays, short-term, six months, one year, then maybe benefit support in the longer run, yeah."
1,"We don't see any   I don't see also like now running in a growth environment started again, right. Quite stable, but I would say that our customer has been extremely resilient. On the retail side, we were growing."
1,"We drove over 12% year-over-year increase, sequentially surpassing the 11% gain from the prior quarter. Our strategy has been to power affiliate fee growth through careful, but steady investment in our core brands where we have made solid progress in strengthening our news, sport and entertainment businesses. Integral to this strategy is live sport."
1,We ended the quarter with approximately $171 million of cash and nothing drawn against our revolving credit facility. Our net debt to cap ratio remained relatively stable and is well within our target range of low to mid 40s percent. We ended the year at 41.
1,"We entered 2017 with a goal of alleviating uncertainty in the debt capital markets. With the successful placement of a $400 million eight-year bond offer and a four-year extension of our revolving credit facility, ARLP met its goal and exited the year with a stable long-term capital structure with ample liquidity. The Alliance partnerships also took the first step towards simplifying our structure through the exchange transaction completed last July, further enhancing our capital markets capacity and access."
1,"We expect International total net sales growth to be around 3% in constant currency. Our October guidance for fiscal 2019 also included expectations for expense leverage, relatively steady operating income margin and EPS growth of around 5%. The incremental investments mentioned earlier will pressure operating expenses more than anticipated in October."
1,We expect noninterest expense to increase slightly on a linked-quarter basis. We expect credit equality to remain relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter. I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.
1,"We expect revenue growth in 2018 to be driven primarily by Tinder, which we believe will account for the vast majority of our sub growth. We expect our non-Tinder businesses to be fairly stable from a revenue and subscriber perspective. We anticipate relatively stable ARPU across our businesses as the mix shift to Tinder, which had historically driven overall ARPU lower, is offset by higher ARPU from Tinder due to Gold."
1,"We expect some normalization in 2018 from the very low levels we experienced in 2017, especially in the Ontario and Pacific regions. Overall, we expect that underwriting performance will continue to be strong, underpinned by our high-quality insurance portfolio, generally stable economic conditions, and unearned premiums of over CAD 2 billion. For a CAD 6."
1,"We expect to continue sourcing additional land parcels with a similar weighting towards controlled land to accelerate our scale while preserving our financial flexibility. Looking at our market portfolio, our increasingly diverse geographic footprint over 10 states provides us with balanced exposure to many vibrant economies along with a more stable growth profile. Starting with the West, the Seattle homebuilding climate is one of the strongest in the U."
1,"We expect to continue to capture the lion's share of the postpaid marketplace for many years to come, especially as we're developing these other growth adjacencies. But we've always done so with balance, with a steady progression on our financial metrics. And you look at our balance sheet today, it is the most healthy balance sheet of any incumbent national carrier in the U."
1,"We firmly believe we are well positioned to produce record results again in 2018 and maintain our average 4% growth trajectory well into the future, similar to the growth we have achieved over the past six years. In doing so, we remain committed to a steady 4% increase in our annual distribution rate going forward, making FUN an attractive investment for many years to come. At this point in time, I will turn the call over to Brian to review our 2017 results in more detail, and then I will discuss our plans for 2018 and our longer term outlook."
1,"We forecast yet another record quarter for vacuum automation products in the March quarter from across the entire spectrum of our customers, including more activity from Korean and Chinese OEMs who are dedicated adopters of our automation solutions to serve the significant equipment opportunities they have selling process tools in their respective domestic markets. Our revenue from advanced packaging applications was again strong and is proving to be more steady growth opportunity. As we'd anticipated, the end market for advanced packaging is now expanding to include meaningful opportunities beyond just TSMC's integrated fan-out lines to now include outsourced assembly and test facilities and some specialty fabs."
1,"We form long-term relationships with these deposit providers. And again, it's a very good stable source of funding for us. Now, the only thing I'll mention here finally that the ABS market also enables us to raise good fixed rate funding for our fixed rate loan portfolio, so very good news there."
1,"We grew revenues by 7% in the first quarter, with increased customer numbers and pricing leading to an improvement in our seasonal underlying operating loss of Â£10 million. Trading for winter is in line with our expectations with steady demand for the Canaries, our largest winter destination and strong growth to Egypt. It is still early in the booking cycle, but demand for the summer is encouraging."
1,We had excellent health and safety performance. Our team's commitment to maintaining safe and reliable operations is the foundation of the Partnership's ability to generate stable earnings and cash flows. We also focused on disciplined growth.
1,"We had great credit performance from our secured lending books of mortgages and vehicle and asset finance, and business banking ended higher given a few lumpy non-performing loans. Overall, our credit loss ratio is showing steady improvement. By geography, we can see that South Africa has reduced its credit loss ratio to 119 basis points."
1,"We have a leadership position in GaN for these types of applications and believe the distinct advantages will accelerate its adoption in the marketplace. Turning to LED Products, the base business is operating at fairly stable levels of revenue and gross margin with encouraging trends in terms of design activity and pricing. We are focusing our technology and energy on more differentiated spaces that value not only our high power leadership, but also our ability to provide highly technical LED solutions for demanding applications such as architectural lighting."
1,"We have already begun reinvesting these proceeds in projects and equipment that we believe will grow the business in 2018. We continue to enjoy strong relationships with our important customers, which is evidenced through our stable cash collection performance throughout the challenging year we had. Fourth quarter days sales outstanding was 61 days."
1,"We have already enacted most of these run-rate cost reductions and will continue to balance spending to deliver the final ICE4 products to market and execute our ramped up technology cadence, while still driving greater operating leverage and efficiency. Regarding full-year 2018 OpEx, our G&A costs should remain fairly steady over the course of the year, while our sales and marketing expense will vary depending on our revenue performance. Base R&D expense should decrease over the year, as we release the final ICE4 products to production."
1,"We have been very careful about touching inventory totally because of the focus on service. I think that as we do get an increasingly stable business model, so if you say what's the most important lever to meet our goal of keeping net working capital broadly flat whilst it's growing, which is the same we had at Coats, same goal there, that's not a commitment but that's an aspiration. I think the biggest single lever will be inventory."
1,"We have begun the commissioning. Once it's steady state, this BTT is expected to deliver the lowest cost ounces in our portfolio, producing about 29,000 Platinum ounces or some 55,000 PGMs, and close to 360,000 Chrome, which will feed into an attractive chrome contract that we have secured with ChromTech. This is a fantastic project and it has brought in some old traditions of surface mining of the dump which is really an innovative process to get all this value lying in the ground, near-term cash for our liquidity."
1,"We have detailed the effective interest rate swaps and floors on the loan portfolio, so that you may better understand the possible reaction and timing of the yield on the loan portfolio to rising short-term rates versus rising longer term rates. Overall our net interest margin should be relatively stable in the first quarter of 2018 relative to the fourth quarter, as we expect some benefit from the December 2017 increase in the fed funds target rate to help. However, this may   will be offset by the effect of tax reform and its impact on the municipal loan and securities portfolio yields, which we estimate to be about 3 basis points of headwind to the net interest margin."
1,"We have not seen an impact on oil change intervals based on inflation. You know, it's one of the great things about our business is that that demand is really steady and that's because whether the economy is super strong or relatively weak, people are going to take care of their vehicles, their investments, their engines. And so, even as gas prices move up, we don't expect a difference in our oil change intervals."
1,"We have obviously, within the direct bookings space, seen a massive shift towards online bookings and away from voice, as an example. That's been steady over the course of the last number of years, including in 2017 where voice has been down mid-single digits and our online bookings has been strengthened. Another observation is, obviously, this is driven, to some extent, by the kind of business in a hotel   it tends to be the more leisure a hotel's demand base, the higher the third-party contributions are to that hotel."
1,"We have one of the largest biosimilar pipelines in the industry. So, really looking forward to   we believe 2018 is going to be a great year, we think, in the face of a lot of capacity perhaps rebases, and people are looking at their product portfolios that we have an opportunity to continue to be that kind of steady industry leader who's got a broad breadth portfolio that is balancing the commodity with our complex high-barrier-to-market products and continuing to mean the most to our customer on a global basis. So, looking forward to 2018, we believe we're off to a great start for a great year, and look forward to your questions."
1,"We have over 41% of horizontal drilling and we think that this trend will also be quite stable and growing for the upcoming years as well. Currently, we have a quite good and stable demand for our premium connections and speaking about our market share for the previous year, it has reached also record numbers, very close to 78% according to our estimation. So, we keep working on the new products which have been mentioned by Vladimir for absolutely different types of drilling, different types of the wells, different types of conditions."
1,"We have presented to you our plan for 2018-2022, and you can see that this plan is driven by addressing the commercial opportunities to win business and grow solidly order intake amounting in aggregate to â‚¬70 billion. Keeping our book to bill equal or above 1 times, growing revenues at a CAGR of 5% to 6% underpinned by our strong backlog and new orders, steadily building our profitability to double digit in 2020 based on Helicopters recovering, steady contribution from Aircraft and Defence Electronics and strict cost control, then investing for sustainable growth in key products and stepping up cash flow generation in the second half of the plan, all in the framework of a disciplined financial strategy based on lowering debt and lowering our cost of funding. Thank you and I will now hand it back to Alessandro for some brief concluding remarks."
1,"We have proven our ability to do this, and it will remain a top priority for us in the future. We expect to support our business model with diverse and stable funding. We also expect to maintain strong capital and liquidity to support our operations, business growth, credit ratings, and regulatory targets."
1,"We have robust margins throughout our guidance range at current gold prices. We are in positive territory at either end of the range, but we see this metric in terms of our ramp up success and how quickly we can get to steady-state at the mine. We will provide guidance for 2019 at the end of this year."
1,"We have supplies on low-end A4 laser that just doesn't have the same sort of attach at that price band. And so what we're doing is we're offsetting some of those headwinds and are confident in our ability to have supplies stable, flat to slightly up in constant currency in FY 2019."
1,"We haven't actively added more people towards the roster for non-qualified mortgages. On the bridge residential side, look, we continue to look for more and I think it is always on the margin, we are adding more people to our roster, but we have a pretty steady state flow from some of the current relationships we have as well. But I think there, I think you would see at least one or two more people added to the roster for bridge residential."
1,"We heard this mandate from our investors and we aligned our plan and our compensation to incentivize these specific behaviors. In addition, our three-year plan was also designed to deliver steady to improving leverage metrics. We expect to maintain approximately $2 billion of annual liquidity throughout the planned period with no additional borrowings."
1,"We hope to get back on the job of rebuilding the business in near future. Our Emerging Markets business performance has been consistently improving on the back of new product launches, entry into new markets such as Brazil and Colombia and supported by stable currency. Russia business grew 5% Y-o-Y in constant currency and 9% in INR terms."
1,"We intend to remain very aggressive in pursuing attractive acquisition opportunities, but the preponderance of early-stage targets in our pipeline makes it more difficult to predict the timing of additional deals. And now I'll briefly turn away from our company's performance to provide an update on the state budget and policy environment, which remain stable to positive in the vast majority of our 36 states. Although there is a lot of activity right now in state capitals across the country, as governors and state legislatures begin the process of establishing new budgets for state fiscal year 2019, there haven't been any material changes since our last call."
1,"We introduced ultraviolet fluorescence filters for a new generation of biomedical instruments that use new fluorochromes. In addition, we unveil our new laser head series that achieves extremely stable and low-noise optical output power needed to enable greater accuracy of measurement in the next generation of flow cytometers. Such high measurement sensitivity flow cytometers is critical for clinicians who need to accurately identify residual traces of target cells or markers."
1,"We look forward to working closely with Tencent and JD to strengthen all three parties' marketing positioning. In particular with the high quality traffic from Tencent and JD, we plan to grow our topline as fast as possible while maintaining a stable net margin, further strengthening our leadership in our core categories and solidifying a strong position in China's fashion industry. This will also enable us to achieve further operating leverage in the long run."
1,"We place a premium on being conservatively leveraged and are committed to maintaining a well-laddered and flexible capital structure as we look to grow the company. Looking ahead, we remain focused on our three-pronged growth platform consisting of a combination of stable growth supported by asset management activities in our core net lease portfolio, expanding our portfolio through acquisitions in the convenience, gas and auto related sectors and selective redevelopment projects. We are confident that we will be able to continue to successfully execute on our strategy throughout 2018."
1,"We plan our spec starts based upon demand within their community and position it to create the most efficiency we can building these houses through the   on a month-to-month, week-to-week basis. It's part of our overall program, and I believe, we believe that it is the reason we've been able to maintain such stable margins for the past three, four years."
1,"We present our directional outlook assumptions for 2018 for each of our business units. For our ILEC Consumer and SMB segment, we expect broadband trends to improve year-over-year with a stable contribution margin percentage. In our Enterprise segment, we expect revenue and contribution margin trends to improve with a material improvement in absolute contribution margin dollars year-over-year, driven by solid growth in our strategic product offerings and interconnection expense reductions."
1,"We propose to stand out from our customers by offering outstanding   an outstanding experience, a simple and fluid experience, we want to have a steady base of mobile premium customers. And also, we want to roll out our FTTH recruitment and reach 4 million customers."
1,"We remain committed to our capital-light business model, but we now have some opportunities where increased CapEx investments will enable us to exploit our technical discriminators that, we expect, will ultimately generate higher returns. As such, we expect to increase capital investments in 2018, with $80 million being a new steady state level of CapEx for the company, up from our prior view of roughly $60 million. Additionally, due to the 2017 enactment date of the Tax Act, we did see some benefit in the fourth quarter, which I'll touch on shortly."
1,"We remain focused on efficiency while also continuing to make strategic investments to support the continued long-term success of our business. On credit, our outlook is stable, that we do expect that loan losses will ultimately migrate upward toward historical levels over time. And finally, on taxes, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 21% for 2018, reflecting the lower statutory corporate rate, the elimination of certain deductions and reduced impact from state taxes, tax credits and tax-exempt income."
1,"We remain very pleased with our overall revenue cycle performance. The way I characterize it, our collectability for deductible cos has stayed pretty stable. When I look at various metrics, we look at on collectability per account."
1,"We resolved our supply base issues from last year's hurricanes. Our end markets remain steady. Medical, industrial, and commercial vehicle markets remain robust, as telecom infrastructure continues to be soft."
1,"We said at the start of the year, we were targeting to be at or above the financial metrics currently required for our existing investment grade credit ratings. As a reminder, our rating with Moody's is Baa1 with stable outlook, and BBB+ with negative outlook with S&P. We estimate we have achieved the target financial metrics at the end of the year, although, of course, the final calculations of the 2017 numbers are yet to be confirmed by the rating agencies, which they consider alongside other qualitative and business risk factors in determining the overall rating."
1,"We saw a little bit better   or a little bit lower re-pricing in the fourth quarter than we saw in prior quarters. So, we're looking for a relatively stable margin rate over the course of the year."
1,"We saw market sentiment improved throughout 2017, and we remain optimistic that our end markets will continue to perform through 2018 at similar levels. Although we will continue to refine our view as the year progresses, our current views for 2018 are for residential construction to increase mid-single digits, non-residential construction to increase low single digits to mid-single digits and the MRO market to remain stable, increasing 1% to 2%. These combined end-market estimates imply an approximate 2% to 3% end market growth estimate for HD Supply's end markets in 2018."
1,"We saw some pull-forward activity. I think probably a modest slowdown in infrastructure after a very strong year around the globe and a pretty stable issuance environment in sub-sovereign and all that then kind of builds to, ultimately to our revenue outlook."
1,"We should gain market shares in front of Mercedes and BMW and Audi. And I would like to see slow and steady rise in our market share, we should have very, very ambitious goal for this and we should not be apologetic about market conditions, about exchange rates, about not having brands or not having products or having whitespaces and all, these are all excuses. I believe we should have very strong committed   commitment to gain market share and I hope as an investor, I'll see that in next three years."
1,"We still have LTL that's more, you know, that's not going to be a 10% to 15% increase that's going to be more in line with the economy and if we can do a layered acquisition. But I think our internal growth is more logistics generated, our accelerated growth is through acquisitions and our steady growth and our margin improvement is going to come because our existing hard assets, I expect to be paid for them in this robust market."
1,"We suspect that the first half of FY 2018 will remain tough, but the measures that I described should start bearing fruit in the second half. Our headquarters in Tokyo will make sure to provide support so that all those efforts will make steady progress. It was our understanding from the outset that the business in America was not extremely profitable."
1,We talked about the growth drivers but what does that mean in terms of the bottom-line because I'm sure that's what most of you care about. So we've talked about our gross margins being very stable with an upward bias. We've talked about in the next calendar year of 2018 basically keeping our operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis flat to 2017.
1,"We were pleasantly surprised that our portfolio witnessed an increase of 5,000 in the quarter, for the quarter group room nights compared to the prior year. Similarly, our group attendance in the fourth quarter was stable and actualised at 83. 5% of their respective room blocks which was right in the middle of our historic fourth quarter average slip of 83% to 84%."
1,"We were very focused on stabilizing the big decline in top-line. We manage stable level of comp store sales in the third quarter and we actually manage to grow about 3% in the fourth quarter, which is a good thing and it's actually a growth rate that we also start seeing at the beginning of this year. So I think that this stabilization and return to growth of retail which then would also in the next foreseeable future, allow us to improve the profitability."
1,"We will continue to make the required investments in innovation and technology to ensure our products and services continue to win in the marketplace. And going forward, we expect our overall R&D spending as a percentage of revenue to be relatively stable. While organic investment remains the primary engine for our growth, we continue to look for opportunities to partner with other industry players in investments that accelerate our life cycle value strategy and vertical content, as we demonstrated by the recent joint venture with Adient for seats, announced earlier this month."
1,"We will continue to refine this measure over time as we analyze all of our capital funding needs. Overall, we feel that we are well positioned to both, support our existing business and also to fund our growing development pipeline of retail and mixed use initiatives while still providing our unitholders with stable and growing distributions. And with that, I will turn it back to Huw."
1,"We will, of course, continue to focus on this area as a combined entity. And as you can from the graph, we should have the opportunity to deliver a very consistent cash generation with the combined conversion having been stable just above 70% in the past four years. Synergies from the combination will help us achieve increased scale as well as growth and cost savings opportunities, all of which will contribute to continued strong cash conversion."
1,"We would have to assume a stable environment in the oil markets. And so, assuming a stable environment, that should be better and then we're always looking at opportunities to drive more market share and other growth in our key markets."
1,"Well, actually we had quite significant increase of our sales in terms of rechargeable products, starting already from let me say Q2 of last year. So, after that our share of rechargeable of hearing aids overall kept more or less stable. I would say less than 10% of our total sales."
1,"Well, first of all the   Steven here, Richard. The new projects don't have an impact on that figure until they stabilize and they'll be into our stable portfolio. So, the real reason is, because you've got the   we've gone to great lengths to talk about the evolving nature of the business, and we're particularly in this environment where last year, over 10% of the shops changed, we are in the process of quite substantial changes taking place and weeding out underperforming retailers and replacing those with obviously high-performing retailers that are really modern and current and relevant in today's world."
1,"Well, I think it's too early to say or to call it. I will say our Q1 performance was steady. It was consistent throughout the quarter except the wireless comment we made earlier where we started slow and we finished strong."
1,"Well, I think our view of the market, I think, is reasonably stable. I think probably flat to very slight low single-digit growth."
1,"Well, I think we've looked at it a couple of ways. When you take a look at our projections, we've kind of projected a stable to a modestly declining net interest margin in 2018. But that said, there are a number of factors here."
1,"Well, I would assume   given that our cost structure has always been fairly stable, I would assume that increases in revenue would increase our EBITDA margin. Cash flow should also continue to be probably above 100%."
1,"Well, we always said it's part of the consolidation. The consolidation was important to maintain stable benefits and pricing for our members and we were able to do that in 2018. Had we not been able to achieve that consolidation, then our members would have been impacted dramatically."
1,"Well, we have always shared with the investors community that we would like to have a very stable dividend payout policy, and we have publicly declared that our dividend ratio is 40% to 50% of our core earnings. So we are still within that direction."
1,"Well, we haven't filed them yet, but all I would say is in terms of our appraisals, they're steady and there's no surprises. And I can't count on the universe of appraisals, those are typically private."
1,"Well, when you look at the kinds of jobs that we've been successful at, they're kind of around that CAD 100 million or less mark. And those have really contributed to the growth of the business, frankly, offsetting our stable MRO work. And so, I would say this year, yeah, I think you're right, it's not a overly compelling commodity sector right now."
1,"We're also seeing a number of new international opportunities that should contribute to our growth, especially waste streams that are very difficult to treat. Once treated at Perma-Fix, we will return these wastes in a stable form for final disposal in the country of origin, but we're currently in the bidding process with the initiatives in the United Kingdom, Mexico and Italy in addition to our Canada business which should be shipping waste to us at Perma-Fix in the second quarter this year. Finally, we're very excited about our new treatment opportunities that may arise out of our recent waste treatability project for the tank waste at Hanford, Washington."
1,"We're being very selective in the activities that we're doing there. We're shifting our focus on India away from import, because again even though I think it's going to be stable on the duty side, there's no reason to expose ourselves to those types of government interventions. So we'll be focusing on getting that segment to stabilize back to a positive cash flow scenario."
1,We're building a specialty unit and it's our goal to add at least one more product to the mix with cosyntropin going forward. So we think we've got a very stable cash flow positive business and that we offer growth opportunities by the prospect of adding additional products to our neurology franchise and building on our specialty franchise with cosyntropin.
1,"We're constantly looking at what we do and we make adjustments from time to time. But we've had nothing significant change in our residential or commercial underwriting, and our average originating LTVs are very similar and holding steady and it had maintained what we've been doing over the last couple of years."
1,"We're excited to begin these partnerships, which will help us explore new market sectors and expand our capabilities. We also continue to see steady contributions from our public equities and strategic investments portfolio. In addition to the new investments we made in 2017, we rebalanced our portfolio through selective trading in public or mature investments where we have made significant gains over the years."
1,"We're focused on something beyond that. Very secure, that ours is a very stable business with a strong balance sheet and probably the best-selling organization ever created in the industry."
1,We're having our greatest success in penetrating the highest fee and highest growth segments of the market. And we keep making steady progress in our goal to expand our operating margin through strict expense disciplines. I'm thrilled to be on this journey with AB and excited about our future prospects.
1,"We're in a period where capital market conditions are causing volatility in REIT shares in the face of generally good economic and market fundamentals. Over the past three years, the market has been more stable; and we've taken advantage of that stability to reinforce our portfolio, strengthen and make more liquid our balance sheet and, with the sale of Cole, simplify the business. Our talented management team has experience through various market cycles and will continue to focus on our business objectives."
1,"We're investing to make 2018 a year of growth and expect our expenses to more closely align with revenue after a year of significant margin improvement. We're proud of the steady progress we made in 2017, and we're confident in our path ahead. We've got significant opportunity ahead of us to put Twitter in as many people's hands as possible and to make the service more relevant to more people every single day."
1,"We're past that, doesn't go to zero, but the largest components was that, hits its apex and starts to come down in terms of intensity that's the key driver. On the other hand, the things we're doing is continued investment behind Business Services, so it's more of those hyper builds that I described earlier together with just a steady given the 50% growth in the usage of the network and the moat we want to have around our broadband product, we continue to properly invest in capacity and speed, fiber deeper in the network, the right approaches together with   to really continue to stay ahead of consumer expectations of the product, which we think is wise, and we're happy to continue to see that usage metric continue to go higher and we no sign of it stopping."
1,"We're starting to see some movement in regulatory in the Asia-Pacific region which I think will boost not only revenue growth but profits in the upcoming years, but it's a pretty steady business. As you can see from the last four quarters, eight quarters, it's pretty steady at that GDP plus 2% to 3%. And as we've been telling you guys from day one, it's probably going to be in that 35% gross margin moving forward."
1,"We're taking a programmatic approach to dealing effectively with the storage of coal ash and other combustion residuals. And steady progress continues on our multi-year project to close wet coal ash storage facilities and convert them to dry methods. Finally, I'd be remiss not to mention some of our recent economic development successes."
1,"We're talking about strategically aligning with customers that do other than ship crude, so we understand that crude is only going to be here for a certain period of time. We're looking for strategic partners with long-term objectives that align with ours, that allow us to have a more stable book of business, and that sort of falls in line with rebalancing business and what serves our franchise well, how we can bring value to the bottom line to help them move their assets, to lower their transportation costs while we bring value to our shareholders. So, those are the type customers that we're talking about, customers that do business not only in crude but also other lines."
1,"We're very pleased with the quarterly results as the outcome from our restructuring efforts are clear. In addition to the improvement in our efficiency ratio, we produced high quality loan growth, while maintaining a stable net interest margin and hired additional commercial bankers. We believe we're well positioned to expand our market share in our high-growth geographies and continue our focus on those services and product lines that provide the greatest opportunity to create value."
1,"We've been actively pursuing a variety of sources and strategies that will meet those needs with the ultimate goal of building an $8 billion to $10 billion asset management business by 2020. Once established, our asset management platform should generate stable revenue streams, similar to our largely prepayment protected servicing revenue that will be used to continue fueling our growth and delivering superior returns to our investors. At Walker & Dunlop, we have cultivated a culture of outperformance that drives us to continuously raise the bar and achieve as exemplified by our number 17 ranking on Fortune magazine's list of Fastest Growing Companies in 2017."
1,"We've been really stable with our overall transaction pricing, come down a little bit over the last couple of years due to portfolio age, which we plan for and expect. We think we'll see a really good pop on EcoSport, we don't have the year-over-year comparison, but we believe that will transact within the segment at a really good number, and will help firm up Escape because with Escape we've been trying to cover the whole gamut without having an entry in the subcompact or mini utility segment and I highlighted some of the increases on Expedition and Navigator, and we have obviously toward the end of the year in that really fast growing mid-segment where our Edge competes, we've got a new Edge, dramatically updated Ford Edge which is already a great product."
1,"We've been working on that. We know from the NCH product that the product has been stable for over four years, and we're continuing to generate data on the GMP products. So, that's an example where you really aren't going to proceed to go from that end-of-Phase meeting."
1,"We've developed capabilities in strategic areas such as Big Data management and visualization, digital analytics, sales and marketing analytics, risk analytics, and consulting with many specifically tailored to vertical requirements. As a result of our approach, we've been able to create a stable recurring business, which is approximately 18% of overall company revenues when combined standalone analytics and embedded analytics. Over the past two years, our analytics business has been growing at a compound annual growth rate of 19% on a constant currency basis."
1,"We've got a lot of ground to cover, as you would have seen, from the various materials that you have received, therefore, I'm not going to spend too much time on the slide. It's suffice to say that our strategy is steady as she goes with our focus on safety, active portfolio management, and tight managing   tightly managing cost and capital, and keeping our balance sheet robust enough to handle any market environment. We are and will continue to invest for the longer term."
1,"We've had an elevated level the last several quarters. As well as, we continue to see a steady decline in the interest component, the interest costs in our margin, which was a contribution this quarter as well. But primarily lower litigation, warranty and interest, and just solid, stable margins on a core basis and as we look forward same outlook there."
1,"We've identified around 130 operated high-margin wells we expect to drill by 2025, a real testament I think to the deep incumbent positions we have in these basins and the materiality of the options that creates. Oman Khazzan and the Lower 48 are examples of huge gas resource bases with long steady cash flows. The Khazzan project has competitive development costs, around two-thirds below our average, and competitive cash margins."
1,"We've introduced 2018 guidance for our comparable core NOI, ranging between 0% and negative 1%. But this guidance includes continued stable performance from our Open Air and Tier One assets. Final note, we're increasingly becoming recognized as the logical aggregator as well as the best-in-class operator and we got a lot more   do to prove ourselves."
1,"We've now brought online about half of the 250,000 tons of capacity we announced in 2015. This added capacity is not only providing us with the needed flexibility to optimize our product and geographic mix, it has enabled us to keep up with strong and steady market growth, no more apparent than in the fourth quarter. So, now moving to Global Cellulose Fibers on page 14."
1,"What I would say is the area where we are intensely focused is around the deposit or the liability side. And what I would say through 2017, we've known for a long time that our funding needs to be improved and gaining low-cost stable deposits will help us in that category. I would say Nashville is a highly competitive market for deposits, and I think the deposit side is where we're going to concentrate and where we could have some slippage."
1,What they really need to be focused on is making sure we're doing   improving underwriting performance and improving the consistency of our delivery. I would hope that we can keep our retention somewhat stable and benefit from at least kind of more flat to moderately positive pricing environment.
1,"What we see, of course, is the total demand and in fact those customers are really generally reflected in   as best referred to the next four after our largest customer. We don't have a specific real visibility to Verizon but we do see them   as generally the trajectory for 2018, as I said, in my prepared remarks was relatively stable in the fourth quarter and changes from that are reflected in our outlook for the first quarter."
1,What we're saying is we're seeing stable volumes in Latin America. Our customers are   we're stable with our customers and our rigid business is in good shape. Our flexibles business is in good shape.
1,"What's the risk, are you buying the early startups. If you are, your risk required return is going to be higher versus if you're buying something more stable. So, I won't give you one answer because it depends on what kind of a technology, what stage of maturity of a company you're looking at."
1,"When doing so, we expect to recognize the payment fees as revenue via an increase in our take rate and record the cost of payment processing and other related fees. When we reach a steady state, with the majority of our volume transitioned to this intermediated model, we would expect annualized incremental revenue of more than $2 billion. This estimate includes an expectation that we will take steps to lower the cost of selling on eBay via a lower all-in take rate."
1,"When this disciplined execution is combined with attractive return profile, we feel confident we can deliver ongoing attractive returns. Slide 10 illustrates the steady growth of our lending footprint as well as the diversity of the overall lending mix. We continue to see demand for financing solutions and opportunities to deploy capital at attractive returns to support our clients' needs."
1,"Where they're going to go? And B, you've invested in the past and sized investments only to have those investments be offset by other factors in the business to keep your profitability stable. So, should we think about this as a similar type of situation?"
1,"which has to be taken out of consolidated reporting to show real net performance. Our net interest margin was stable at around 15% in the long-term, our cost income ratio continued to improve year-over-year, our cost of risk is coming down in the long-term, but was subject to a short-term increase in 2017. And our return on average equity was 14."
1,"While a reduction in the corporate tax rate is expected to increase our earnings and provide additional cash, our capital allocation priorities have not changed. We plan to continue to invest in the growth of our business, return capital through dividends with a goal of steady annual increases, pay down our debt, and evaluate share repurchases. Our quarterly results once again generated strong cash flows, which enabled us to reduce our debt by an additional $75 million and pay out dividends of nearly $31 million, while still ending the year with adjusted cash and investments of $120 million and a leverage ratio of 1."
1,"While Alpine High may take a bit of time to attain critical mass, with its extremely low entry cost and attractive recycle ratios, it will drive significantly improved ROCE for Apache Corporation for many years to come. Next I would like to provide some color on our Alpine High midstream operations, where we continue to make steady progress on multiple fronts. Construction on these facilities began in November 2016."
1,"While companion animal continue to grow faster than livestock, its growth rate will moderate as our dermatology portfolio and other new products grow off a larger base in 2018. Our adjusted cost of sales, as a percentage of revenue, is expected to be approximately 32% in 2018, an improvement of around 100 basis points over 2017 and driven by manufacturing cost reductions, price increases, and stable product mix. We expect SG&A for the year to be between $1."
1,"While containers grew by 22%, other bulk cargo grew by 8%. Today, 62% of our volumes are stable and long-term cargo compared to 61% at the end of quarter two of FY 2018. Our strategy to diversify and handle all types of cargo at all the ports continue, we intend to handle containers at Dhamra port during the current quarter, that is Q4."
1,"While each offer greater margin opportunity and growth potential, these contracts can be a bit more volatile in the short-term. So, hopefully, as you can see, our ABM contract mix is complex, but it provides us a stable and durable base to grow on. With the announcements of our proposed new segment structure for fiscal 2018, we would like to provide you with an outlook for our operating margin by segment, because as in 2017, it will be challenging to assess our year-over-year performance due to the integration of GCA into our new reportable segments."
1,"While our cigarette share declined by 0. 4 points to 33% for the year, we essentially recorded stable sequential share at that level across all four quarters. The 2018 excise tax took effect in January 1, resulting in a weighted average excise tax increase of 10."
1,"While our revenue in first quarter P&C backlog, excluding CH2M, was down slightly versus last year, the gross margin in backlog increased year-over-year. I'm very pleased with how our P&C team have held backlog steady through the oil market downturn over the last several years. This is a direct result of our team's solid execution against our strategy to focus on improving project delivery and enhancing the mix of new business."
1,"While the board reserves the right to look at the dividend on a quarterly basis, we plan to shift the dividend increase to the first quarter, our review cycle. While tax reform drives an increased level of earnings and cash flow, our dividend reset, primarily driven by the overall capital position, outlook for stable earnings growth and the balanced approach to returning capital back to shareholders. In fact, this is not the first time we've had significant increases in the dividend."
1,"While we're optimistic about the long-term growth opportunities for industry in our business, the priority for 2018 continues to be managing our costs and continuing to invest in our products and business improvement opportunities. Our 2018 forecast assumes relatively stable industry demand across all regions. Our plan includes market share improvement with price increases of about 1."
1,"With all that said, let me provide a few highlights from the quarter before turning the call to Warren. We seem to have found a steady rhythm across our businesses where it seems each quarter we can point to some accomplishments while also acknowledging where we have challenges and opportunities for even better performance. This past quarter was no exception."
1,"With Layne, we are broadening our portfolio and expanding our national footprint to better meet customer needs. Third, we will realize a number of financial benefits, including significant synergies and earnings accretion, as well as additional sources of stable and diverse revenue for our shareholders. The details are in the release we sent out early today."
1,"With respect to the Agile program, approximately 45% of our total unit shipments this quarter and 65% of our marine commercial shipments were in connection with this new offering. Service revenue for the fourth quarter remained steady at $25. 3 million comparable with the prior year, mini-VSAT Broadband airtime revenue was up approximately 3% from the prior year fourth quarter."
1,"With that, let's move to have a closer look at each of the business areas and start with Table Top, our biggest business area. And there, we are happy to see that we are continuing to increase our sales and we see overall very stable development for almost all our markets. The sales is largely driven by growth in our premium napkins with the airlaid material as well as in candles and accessories."
1,"With the completion of construction and startup of Cerro Moro this year, we expect our overall net free cash flows to increase given the step change contribution from our newest operation. In anticipation of the construction ramp up at Cerro Moro, we had put in place commodity price protection for both copper and gold to ensure we would generate steady cash flows during this important time when we are investing more heavily in our growth. Combined with the steady performance of our operations during 2017, you can see that the consistency of our traditional H1/H2 annual splits and cash flow generation held up during the year."
1,"With the liquidity at the end of the quarter of CAD 2. 7 billion, we have solid investment grade credit ratings, stable outlooks, and attractive rates on our outstanding debt with further reduction opportunities on this front in 2018. Turning to 2018, our financial guidance released today reflects our expectation to grow total revenue in the range of 3% to 5%."
1,"With the startup of production at Cerro Moro, DD&A will be higher year-over-year at around $450 million. Over our guidance period, we expect steady annual growth in our GEO production, first from our newest mine Cerro Moro, but also from contributions at Malartic, Jacobina, and Minera Florida. Silver production is growing more significantly from Cerro Moro and also drive the GEO increases."
1,"Without a doubt, we are the number one magazine operator in the country, reaching 115 million women each and every month, along with advertising. Of course we have a growing digital business, a very stable circulation activity now spread over 60 million individual consumers, a highly profitable brand licensing activity, e-commerce events, and content marketing. We have significantly accelerated the scale of our digital business, and we'll talk about that in just a few minutes, with nearly 170 million monthly unique visitors and over 10 billion video views."
1,"Without beating a dead horse here, I wanted to go back to the ACA-related issues, as I think that'll be a key focus. And I'm just trying to appreciate further how some of those lives, given that lives were relatively stable, did not spill over into your other customers and, therefore, generate revenue for you. Is it just the fact that that will take some time for those lives that spilled into existing customers to ramp up and drive growth?"
1,"without incremental tax increases our financial flexibility. With current global growth rates, the tax bill, reduced regulation, and relatively stable oil prices, we believe the conditions are set for inflection in many of our served markets. Quickly looking at our full year 2017 results, revenues were $3."
1,"Working capital flows remain stable and predictable, volume driven and showing continued improvement on debtor and WIP collection. Our supply chain facility has been stable for 2017 and remains highly valued by our supply chain. The Construction and Services division are both strongly net cash with a very strong cash conversion in Services."
1,"Yeah I think the visibility going into 2018 is strong. The fact that we've really seen a lot of the volume related to the refinancing side of the market kind of disappear, weed itself out during the course of 2017, creates a lot more of a stable market condition in 2018. And so, that makes forecasting a lot easier, because when you have a pretty significant market shift, you know, that can have ramifications throughout the mechanics of a forecast model."
1,"Yeah, because we don't see at this stage in this 2019 and 2020 an impact of the 5G on our network, we can forecast a stable CapEx, overall CapEx for Orange Belgium."
1,"Yeah, I mean I can say is that, over the last five years we've increased our market share by 25%. It's probably pretty stable right now, getting in that last 25% is more complicated just because   our competition is Medtronic and they've got products in the market. And so   I mean we definitely see them out there, but mostly they're doing it and bundling it with other valve tools or things like that."
1,"Yeah, I mean, listen, I think that we started to see international kind of turn the corner in the second half of 2017, and I think our expectation is that we continue to see at least steady levels of performance in the international markets from where we are in Q4 if not perhaps improving somewhat. You know that our exposure in international is not as broad as some of the large caps, but where we operate in Latin America and Asia and the Middle East and in Europe and the North Sea, I mean I think that we are certainly more favorable in the U."
1,"Yeah, I think on the timing, Bascome, obviously when you look at some of the places we have good exposure for growth like pulp and paper. They obviously are a pretty steady line of more facilities, but we saw a nice peak in the fourth quarter simply because of e-commerce buying. So I think we're probably back end weighted in the year where we see some significant lift, but obviously it depends on fuel, it depends on truck capacity, it depends on truck pricing, which we all think are headed in the right direction."
1,"Yeah, I think the broader backdrop that we provided in our comments that we have seen a pretty stable environment on retail pricing throughout Q3 and continued into Q4. As we talked about in the quarter, we did see some favorability in our price mix on tires."
1,"Yeah, so our sensing is that margins are going to remain stable."
1,"Yeah, the update   our performance update is through January, so occupancy steady to year-end. The MH rent is slightly ahead of guidance."
1,"Yeah, we're   we're looking at it at just sort of a steady upward trend, almost a slow   slow ascent, if you will, from Q1 onward to the end of the fourth quarter."
1,"Yeah, we've reached the stable portfolio with our current run rate. That's why the full year grew by 12%."
1,"Yeah. From a rev rec perspective, I would say for all the products, our expectation is that we'll see steady growth over the year, quarter-on-quarter. One thing, just as a heads-up, we did have stacking orders for Baxdela in Q1."
1,"Yeah. I mean, Usource has remained a steady contributor to the company. I would say, the   what drives that business is volatility in the markets."
1,"Yeah. I think the fourth quarter is evidence of how we've changed this mortgage business and made it more stable, because we've got different levers we can pull, as we said in the speech, depending on where the market opportunity is. And so, while many others maybe even most others, saw declines in production in Q4 versus Q3, as well as Q4 versus last year's Q4, you didn't see that happening at Flagstar."
1,Yeah. I would say   I mean I would just add that the percent of NOI has actually been declining as our NOI has grown because the absolute dollar amount has really remained relatively stable for the past five years.
1,"Yeah. In your core learning and talent management market, Europe's recovered, seems like the enterprise has been fairly steady this year, the larger customers in the U. S."
1,"Yeah. It's tough to predict the timing because you get courts and council approvals and things like that, but we're making very steady progress and we're doing a good number each year."
1,Yeah. Our customer acquisition cost has been pretty stable. And maybe actually let's take a pause and walk you through the customer economics.
1,"Yeah. So given the lead times in the business and us ramping up to that, it won't really impact the margin until Q4 this year, and on a   not a huge scale given the way we're moving into this, which again is focused on our replenishment portion of the assortment which has more steady characteristics to it and that in total, makes up about 30% of the assortment. I don't think we'll get the entire 30% to the direct import model, but we are just going SKU by SKU and looking for the biggest opportunities and going up for those first."
1,"Yeah. Starting with the first question, which is a pretty good one, about the forecast we have published, like always we have done our proper budgeting process and, of course, we normally expect to get some revenues as well as EBITDA in the middle of the range which we give, and then we have some downside cases and some upside cases depending on the upside case, of course, how strong the utilization rate can be further developed in 2018, if it stays stable over the entire year, or is it slightly reducing during the year 2018, as well as we have done some calculations and some cases about the development of the logistics businesses. So we have also here some upside and downside case, on the one hand, and then clearly NACCO is clearly not calculated in the â‚¬340 million to â‚¬370 million."
1,"Yeah. The Formula 1, the revenue sharing agreement, I suppose in your 2022 target are assumed as a steady state as they are today."
1,"Yeah. There's not   if you look at our business, I mean, there has been pretty steady increase in supply in the Cancun, Riviera Maya market since the early 2000s. And one of the nice aspects about the all-inclusive business is actually bigger markets tend to do better, and it's kind of like Las Vegas or Orlando, where you get to a size where you're highly attractive to both the charter airline business, as well as the scheduled airlines, as well as groups and others."
1,"Yeah. We think as we get into Q3 here that we can hold our OpEx fairly steady. We will have some increases for sales compensation, we'll have some variability there, we'll have our annual pay increases."
1,"Yeah. Well as we explained on the 23rd day, Andy, our dividend policy remains stable and sustainable and we review it at every period on a transaction. And we've taken the decision to increase the dividend by 3% this time compared to the 5% that we declared at the time of the AXA deal and again at the time of the Abbey deal."
1,"year-over-year. And our Cranes segment where pricing is more stable than it is necessarily increasing. Then secondly, would be within the   our manufacturing efficiency."
1,"Yes, Brennan, that's a good question, yes. It's from our mid-20s steady state go-forward rate we'll take 500 bps. We're estimating today's   again based on today's stock price levels estimating approximately a 500 basis point benefit."
1,"Yes. When we put our annual plan together, we assumed that there would be a steady increase in LIBOR, which was based on the kind of consensus kind of views of the world, and so we have already factored those increases in our guidance. Right now, we have around $1."
1,"You asked about the sustainability of the increased dividend. In the next fiscal year, while keeping our commitment to the minimum total dividend amount per year, we will make decisions by figuring out whether the core operating cash flow obtained is stable or volatile in nature. To answer your second question, on the forecast for the fourth quarter looking conservative, in the third quarter, there are some major peculiar factors including the tax reform in the U."
1,"You had a question about CapEx as well. Our CapEx has been relatively stable. Last year, we were at 4."
1,"you know look I just   I do want to get a sense though as you know because this is sort of the next question, obviously, the people are going to ask right, is with OTT or online network, a lot of these guys make huge marketing pushes and over invest just for the sake for lane grabs. I don't think that's in your philosophy and it sounds like you're able just even with some of the low-hanging fruit here to continue to grow this thing and keep margins somewhat stable. But if you could at least maybe high level give us your philosophy on investments in growing the platform and what your kind of seeing in efficiency in paid channels and sort of initial return on investment based on the platform you have?"
1,You mentioned that your net debt to EBITDA level is significantly lower than the average for your industrial peers. You kept your dividend stable at the same level that we've seen for the last eight years. I think payout ratio of close to 70% compared to core income is at the upper end of your range.
1,"You see our guidance in 2018 is another step towards that. As we mentioned before, we expect our progress to be steady over a multiyear timeframe to achieve that long-term target. That includes actions we're taking throughout the enterprise to reduce our cost structure, market-based actions, reducing every element of our cost structure, both in terms of direct labor costs but also significantly in our supply chain."
1,"Your servicing income is about right and so the difference would be due to the saleable component of the business. So, to the extent that we think that's going to start stabilizing next year, the income from mortgage banking should be pretty stable from the fourth quarter."
0,"01) adjustable rate mortgages that we retain on our balance sheet. Our consumer portfolio, which predominantly consists of the residential mortgage loans, increased to 24% from the end of the prior quarter and 60% for the full year."
0,"13) are on track. As a conclusion, in general, fourth quarter of 2017 was smooth operation for PCG with good volume recorded from PC Fertiliser Sabah and stable Olefins & Derivatives business segment operation. We will continue to focus in operational excellence in delivering our plan."
0,"21% for the quarter, an increase of 10 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase reflects the ongoing resets of our adjustable loan and securities portfolios and our ability to manage deposit costs through the first leg of the rate cycle. Earning assets increased by approximately $728 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016."
0,"3% cash-on-cash return for our shareholders. We attribute our success to, one, our differentiated underwriting platform; two, our ability to consistently generate the vast majority of our net investment income stable, cash interest income in an amount that covers our dividend; three, our focus on running the business with an efficient balance sheet and always fully utilizing inexpensive appropriately structured leverage before accessing more expensive equity; and four, our alignment of shareholder and management interests. Our highest priority continues to be our focus on risk control and credit performance which we believe over time is the single biggest differentiator of total return in the BDC space."
0,"32) and the Beta Bionics Group demonstrating over the course of an 11-day study that if you put these patients on a dual-hormone artificial pancreas setting, then you can actually obtain very stable glucose levels without the risk of hypoglycemia as compared if you look at the other bar to the normal insulin-only treatments. So, what does it take to actually make these   to realize these systems today."
0,"35) CapEx, what would be our maintenance CapEx on a, like a steady-state basis, assuming we do not expand our capacities further?"
0,"40, which will be the proposal to the AGM in May. This continues our consistent dividend policy since 2010 with stable or increasing dividend. And as I mentioned, we returned in last year additional money with the buyback to our shareholders of roughly â‚¬10 million."
0,45 billion purchase loan portfolio. Our capital ratios held steady in 2017 as our strong capital growth modestly outperformed our balance sheet expansion. Tangible book value per share rose $0.
0,"5 billion of which ZAR 600 million will be spent in 2018. The group EBITDA margin improved to 18%, supported by strong mine to market margins from our own portfolio of 32% and from our joint venture portfolio of 20% together with stable POC margins of 9%. These margins delivered free cash flow from operations of ZAR 2."
0,"5 percentage points. On a steady state, if you think of our variable contribution margin as being in the high 60s, that's what the drop-through should be after you've gone through that break-even level. So, anything above 3."
0,"5%, a slight flattening out in the 2008/2009 major financial crisis. But just a steady increase in the consumption of oil, and about 25% of this is for transportation usage, but, of course, it's used in a variety of other needs of mankind. And actually in 2017 and 2018, the expectation is that that growth will be even higher than the average CAGR in 1."
0,"5%, which is at the lower range of our   which is at the lower end of our target range of 30% to 40%. Our weighted average cost of debt is stable at 3. 8%, with 81% either hedged or fixed."
0,"5%. So Mexico is a very stable market for our Industrial Services business and so we think that this year, first because of the backlog which is going into operation also with the recovery of oil prices, some of the contracts that had been awarded, we were asked to delay, there's two offshore platforms with crude oil prices back then with crude oil prices, but then they said, we should delay and now they've reactivated those projects. And so, we're quite confident that that market will recover, plus as you will have noticed, the fall in the Mexican market has been offset greatly by growth in Asia and Africa with Industrial Services."
0,"About $0. 04 of this earnings improvement is attributable to higher net interest margins as a result of higher cash yields on our 100% adjustable rate portfolio and a 13% decline in mortgage prepayment activity. Together, these positives outpaced higher borrowing costs."
0,"aggregated Bedding data. In the fourth quarter, innersprings were down 2%, but dollars of just innersprings, take box spring constructions out of it, which is actually a comfortable loss because it becomes really good Adjustable Bed business. But if it's just innersprings, we were up mid-single digits."
0,"Although average current account balances in rands declined as shown on this slide, current account balances in SBSA grew by an encouraging 6% year-on-year. We continue to lengthen the term of our deposit book in the run-up to full net stable funding ratio compliance, as can be seen in the growth of term and NCD categories. Analyzing our year-end deposit balances of ZAR 1."
0,"Although the financial implications of these transactions are small in the near-term, this is an exciting opportunity for the company over the long-term. As we've discussed in the past with all of you, we strive to provide stable growing gas utility earnings, while seeking to add earning streams that have a similar risk in cash flow profile as our regulated gas utility. We believe the regulated water utility sector, not only fits this profile but it also aligns well with our core capabilities."
0,"And a quick one as well on your working capital. I was surprised to see an upward movement in the fourth quarter, which is a bit counter-intuitive given the steady rise in oil prices. Could you elaborate a little bit on this?"
0,"And AXS-09, just as a background, resulted from us leveraging our knowledge of the bupropion molecule and also our chiral chemistry and formulation expertise. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a stable chirally pure single enantiomer of bupropion has been formulated and dosed in a clinical trial. And, in fact, we've dosed now both enantiomers of bupropion."
0,"And certainly as we talked yesterday, we share a common goal, which is to   we've got to recycle the cup, but that's not good enough. We have to move forward with a recyclable cup and even the compostable cup, and your ideas of let's encourage more of the reusable cups. And so, we sell the reusable cups in our stores and we're going to do more around that."
0,"And just two more follow-ups, one on Formula 1. I suppose your assumption is as steady state as the rules are today."
0,"And manufacturing is very much in our favor because, even if you use a secondary prevention dose that we're currently using of 600 milligrams per year in two doses, we only need two injection devices. It's a room temperature stable RNA double strand, of course. This is in more contrast to the treatment burden of 2 grams to 5 grams a year of a monoclonal antibody, with 26 fairly sophisticated autoinjectors, given that patients need to treat themselves because the burden on the healthcare system would be too great to ask healthcare professionals to do it."
0,"And the comment about higher volume discounts tied to that, is that just growing within certain customers? I just want to separate that from your comment that the bill pay spread was stable. That's it."
0,"And then, our Petroleum & Chemicals business, we all know the story of what happened over the last several years. But when you look at our backlog performance on the right hand side, I don't think you can see any other E&C competitor that was able to show stable backlog 2015, 2016 and 2017. And we were able to achieve that and we were able to do that because of our strategy where we focus on more O&M sustaining capital businesses versus going after those big sort of lump sum, fixed price contracts that have gotten some of our competitors into trouble."
0,"And then, the next one for me is somewhat transactional. Plains has given you a nice   or the Freeport Properties have given you a nice stable cash flow source in the Gulf of Mexico. One of your partners is in bankruptcy, Cobalt."
0,And we've been pretty successful in bringing several of those to market here over the course of the last 12 months. The other area where we're shifting gears and really amping up our efforts in conjunction with the new resources that joined our company on January 1 is on this whole area of what I'll call bowl pressing replacing traditional CPET bowls with paperboard bowls with various coatings that provides a grease and water barrier and yet tend to be more recyclable and compostable. So those would be two real areas I'd point you to.
0,"As far as pricing is concerned, we are anticipating it to be relatively flat in Q1 and Q2 with some minor tweaks to offset any direct input cost increases that may arise. It is too early to be able to assess how second half 2018 pricing will look, but our current view is that it will likely remain stable. So I want to thank all of our staff for their contributions in making 2017 a significant turnaround year for the company."
0,"Because otherwise, sometimes we have to borrow from banks, and rupee borrowing will be very costly compared to the Sekisui line which is very, very cheap for us. And last three, four years, we are seeing that the currency is quite stable, and that is helping us."
0,"But the thing that I would say is there's a very strong emphasis on capital employed at the Wheel business and also efficiencies, investment selectively in equipment that will allow us to obtain higher margins. Our margins are increasing and I think we make the over-the-hump in the Wheels side of that business, the market has gotten more stable. All right, on GBW, it's more complex."
0,"But to be able to achieve it, it's not something you go out and announce that anyone can do. In a highly competitive market stable, what you need to do is you need to have your competitiveness in good shape, you need to have a competent organization with a determined drive to do it. And as I talked about courage is probably one of the most important things here."
0,But what do you think that cadence looks like over the course of the year by quarter? Is that something that ramps up over the course of time or is that something that can become a little bit more steady in terms of performance earlier?
0,"C. has remained stable around 34%, Ontario and other markets in Central and Eastern Canada have increased from almost nothing to more than a quarter of our book. Alberta remains an important market for us at about one-third of our total."
0,"Could you clarify what portion of products still have elevated lead times now? And I guess as those lead times start to come down due to your capacity additions, do you anticipate any changes in order patterns or book-to-bill rates as those remaining products come down or should we be pretty stable from here?"
0,"For sure, we're seeing growth with our large customers, but we're also doing what we can to penetrate further down throughout that retail base, offering different types of programs to services, retailers, a quick ship program, direct-from-factory, container-direct programs. So, that's really an important part of the combination of our Fashion Bed and Adjustable Bed business. So, fortunately, strong book at our major customers and continuing to drive further penetration throughout the retail chain."
0,"FRE accelerated by 26%, and our economic net income increased by over 30%, both representing the strong momentum in our core management fee business and strong fund performance across our entire platform. Our business has continued to benefit from several important industry trends, namely, the faster growth and demand for alternative investments as investors seek higher returns with less volatility; the consolidation opportunity, as limited partners shrink the number of their GP relationships, and managers like Ares strive to achieve economies of scale; and lastly, the global trend away from traditional banking and the acceptance of private debt as an investable asset class. To capitalize on these trends, we've continued to scale our business development team."
0,"Got it. Just one quick clarification around, so do you see a footfall drop in your stores around that Black Friday weekend or it generally tends to remain stable?"
0,"Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask you just about the fourth quarter performance of the actual   the Life Storage portfolio of stable property to 70, the NOI there went down year-over-year and it looks like it was driven by a pretty sharp increase in expenses. Is that one-time in nature or is that something that you would expect that level of increases moving forward?"
0,"How competitive is it in return? You said they're stable, but what drives your purchases still there today?"
0,"How do you feel about that? And then just one clarifying question, you said the margin on your mortgages had been stable. When I look at page 38 in your Fact Book, it looks like it's sort of taking a slight dip down or is this something I'm not reading right?"
0,"Hyatt Embarcadero, Boston Park Plaza, Marriott Long Wharf, those are chunky assets where the asset value is significantly in excess of the bottom end of our portfolio. So we have been very direct with our shareholders that if it means sitting on outsized amounts of investable cash and being patient to reinvest that, then that's fine with us. Keep in mind that incremental cash just represents earnings growth in the future."
0,I close today by setting out our strategic priorities for 2018. Cash generation continues to be our key metric as it underpins our stable and sustainable dividend. We are clearly on track to be at the top end of our Â£1 billion to Â£1.
0,"I don't know how to exactly to phrase this, but is it   is it philosophical, is it a bandwidth issue? I mean if you have enough sponsors, you will do more shows or are you essentially putting more resources to work in the other channel that is clearly the more stable higher value aspect of the business and that's kind of why you are deriving this forecast and what you are seeing at this time?"
0,"I don't think in the area that we've been involved in. So I think lot of the growth is moped drivers with an L-plate on, which is a slightly different role to our employed benefited employment rights, stable, 40 hours a week, rostered. It's   we're not part of the L-plate moped gig economy."
0,"I have two questions, but I'll start with the first one on mining. And since you track your mining equipment installed base, do you know if the average age of the fleet has come down last year or was it stable or up? Or, in other words, what's the proportion of your fleet that has been replaced in the last 12 months?"
0,"I presume your comments on the positive impact of your dollar sourcing relies on pricing in Europe being relatively stable. Obviously, historically, lower dollar prices in Europe have tended to be passed through to some degree to customers, are you assuming that this won't happen this year?"
0,I think the team has said that your potential adjustable content is about $9 per phone. Where did that sit last year and where do you expect that to trend kind of 2018/2019 as you look at your design win profile?
0,"I was just wanted to follow up again on this capacity and depreciation and amortization. On your slide 12, you have   depreciation's been relatively stable for the last three years despite CapEx somewhat above   well above depreciation. What is it now, that's coming on?"
0,"I will come back total in details on the guidance. I need to tell you that our goal is to slightly improve our operating margin throughout Valeo excluding the Valeo Siemens impact, but because of the very much uncertainty of the raw material prices and the exchange rates that we prefer to be at that stage of the year cautious and guide to the stable operating margin. And of course, concerning Valeo Siemens because of the â‚¬10 billion order intake we are having, we need to invest and we have a negative contribution which means that the line, the JV and Associates will be negative 0."
0,"I'll now turn briefly to discuss our 2018 guidance and then I'll turn the call back to Ron to provide an update on our Shahuindo and Bell Creek projects as well as our longer term pipeline opportunities. Tahoe has successfully achieved a steady increase in our annual gold production for the last three years and we are well-positioned to meet our goal of 500,000 ounces by 2019. As part of last night's earning release, we also provided a gold guidance timeline for 2018 and a three-year outlook for gold."
0,"In terms of listening to all this, nobody likes prepayments, everybody would like to see growth, et cetera. But when you're talking about core yields holding steady, some positive portfolio rotation building up the quality of the business and then your ability to refinance high cost debt. It seems like we're in a pretty good   you'd like to grow, but you're in a pretty good position to earn and cover your dividend."
0,"It doesn't necessarily mean the biology is any different. And so it may be that for a population, that is a little less stable that hasn't been marinating in the statin for a long time unlike FOURIER. Maybe there will be greater benefits for them."
0,"It was, definitely. It was however stable in one region, but three out of four major region in the world meaning hydrogen was growing."
0,"It would be logical that those elements could slightly decline over time. So I think that is probably   we certainly   our original estimates did think   we did have a growth, a steady growth in that space. So I think what the VA does is it actually allows us to say, hey, this core business can actually have a decent growth perspective because I think the way the VA likely will flow as the past quarters are issued and the projects ramp up will create a nice sequential growth year-over-year-over-year of revenue that I think does help us get to a place where our core business is growing."
0,"Just in two years, you had significant deterioration in experience and these are sizable reserve builds. What does that say about   I mean, the ability to deliver steady profit also kind of somewhat would insinuate that your reserves would be adequate, but how should we be looking at that in that context?"
0,"Just three quick questions for me. First on your mining profitability, so Q4 was a bit down in terms of margins, in terms of EBITDA, maybe you mentioned it, but could you again briefly outline the key drivers for this, because it looks like production was relatively stable. Also, on your cost outlook for 2018, could you give us an understanding on the energy cost inflation, which you're seeing across your smelting portfolio, how much of that is still to come through in 2018?"
0,"Let me finish on slide 9 here. While there are a lot of data points in this table, as you can see, I hope you can see that we are making steady progress through our comprehensive transformation. We've been consistently doing what we say."
0,"Michelle, given that long-term goal that I think you just said of high single digits, can you talk a little bit more about the selling solutions bucket? Can that also grow high single digits in your view or should we be thinking about that as more of a stable or a low single-digit growth business? And my follow-up, I'll just ask it now."
0,"My question is, and I think Ron might have alluded to this, when would we expect   I know you haven't released nor are you going to release the expected annual revenue from this contract   but when will it be at that run rate? It sounds like the second half but   and then should it be sort of steady over the course of the year given the SaaS component?"
0,"Obviously, your first half credit was different from your second half credit. Are you talking about full-year stable or stable from sort of fourth quarter levels?"
0,"Okay, great. And just sort of following from that, it sounds like that, you know as you I think you said in your opening remarks, NAV is the focus over perhaps over FFO growth and for 2018 we might be looking at a slight decline in investment properties, balances, and a slight decline from the sort of stable cash flow earning side of the business in favor of maybe lowering a little bit of leverage and generating liquidity and positioning for the coming pipeline of developments that you have underway. Is that the right way to think about it?"
0,Okay. And you build this to keep your leverage levels fairly stable?
0,Our next question comes from Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
0,Our next question comes from Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.
0,"Our next question comes from Peter Stabler, Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question."
0,"Our originations were up slightly year-over-year to $196 million, with purchase volume up $27 million and refinance volume down $25 million. Our loans sold this quarter were down relative to a year ago, as we are holding more of our adjustable rate loans on balance sheet given their favorable credit and return characteristics. On slide 13, expense control and a focus on operating leverage continues to be the strength of the company."
0,"Returns are challenged in that space. I still think, when you look around our asset footprint that we have, we can find investable projects that exceed our cost of capital. We'll do those."
0,"S. , just wondering if there's any opportunity for an inflection in growth in its existing indications or should we be looking for more of a steady climb throughout the course of this year? Thanks."
0,"Sir, your ARPU has been stable quarter-on-quarter and, in fact, down on a Y-o-Y basis. You're doing GPON, you're offering more data."
0,"So clearly competitive. And   but, in reference to April's earlier comment around the number of smaller lenders recently moving up pricing, if you were to follow suit, would that change your NIM guidance to broadly stable for this year? And..."
0,"So we're spending a lot of time on that effort. So from a cost structure standpoint, we believe the labor environment is in a pretty stable place and in line with what our expectations are."
0,"So we've talked about it a bunch in the past, Patrick, covered this before. We broadly captured 10% to 12% of our customers' investable wallet. And so broadening our span of products to really appeal in the wealth management space, we think, is an important point of strategy."
0,"So without growth CapEx, that's what you would expect. I think what we've identified, though, is based on our investable portfolio that we have today, we think we can continue to find new opportunities to reinvest in this platform. I think what we have guided to historically is that while CapEx in 2019   or in 2018 will be between $475 million and $525 million that we would expect it to glide down to be a lower level than that, obviously with run and maintain being somewhere between $200 million and $250 million."
0,"So, for 2018, what should we expect for   in terms of gross margin? Should we expect a continuous improvement throughout 2018 or should we expect to remain relatively stable at the level shown in fourth quarter 2017?"
0,"So, I have two quick questions, one on property development and another on dividend. I see your property development schedule which is on the Hong Kong completion volume which is quite stable at 3 million square feet on average for the next three years. Given that you have quite a lot of land bank, 80 million square feet, is it possible to increase your development completion volume, or do management have such plan on this?"
0,"So, if the rate hike occurs but all of the activity occurs on the short end, that's a dynamic that we can't totally project. But in that regard, I can tell you that 49% of our loan portfolio is adjustable rate in some form or fashion, and 32% of that is tied to prime. So, we should get more lift from rate hikes than we do from the pressure on the short end of the curve on the funding side."
0,"So, it was a little back end loaded. As far as how that stacks up to drive growth, it's four to six months for a sales rep, an inside sales rep to get to what we call steady state or kind of their end of curve. Now, they will contribute some before that."
0,"So, it's a pretty nice increase, I mean. So, I was just curious what the drivers of that were and if it was specific to some of your larger more mature bases versus kind of steady adoption across the account base?"
0,"So, it's like this. We started with chilled cast iron camshafts and have moved on to then getting ductile iron, hybrid and assembled camshafts into our stable."
0,"So, where do you see the organization now? Do you think it's on stable footing or do you still need to invest more in your turnaround effort in that market? And then just secondly, on the three new orders you secured for Unity, please, can talk about the prices you are paying for these orders?"
0,"Thank you, Ted and Ron. We're pleased with our fourth quarter results as the spread remain relatively stable and non-GAAP operating earnings increased despite continued headwinds from low interest rates. Although our sales were down on a year-over-year basis, we're pleased with the sequential increase and the renewed momentum we are seeing at both American Equity Life and Eagle Life."
0,"Thank you. And then separately please on Europe, it looks like your guidance implies roughly stable EBITDA, of course, in spot conditions. Can you just talk a little bit about some of the cost pressures you're seeing in Europe from coking coal and iron ore, given the unique raw materials dynamics there versus in the U."
0,Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Stabler of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
0,Thank you. Our next question is from Peter Stabler from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
0,Thank you. We'll take our first question from Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities.
0,"Thanks, Ken. Today, I'll review the steady and important progress that we continue to make on our Fund platform's buy-fix-sell mandate. Beginning with acquisitions, as discussed on several calls, our funds have been pursuing a barbell strategy, acquiring both high-quality value-add properties and high yield or other opportunistic investments."
0,"That is continuing to give us significant wind on our savings accounts growth and we therefore see the CASA journey continuing to be pretty robust and strong, even from here. And therefore on the increase in   a steady increase in our CASA, including the fact that the 6% is working to our advantage for a faster delta growth compared to the industry is a   is something which we see as continuing from here and we are happy to see that number grow at   and at a very fast clip going forward. On the matter of NIM, I think there are two or three things, which we need to keep in mind."
0,"That leads to expectations about 10% compound growth in EPS over the medium term. Again incorporates stable interest expense, our low to mid 20% tax rate and it's in line with the cadence of I just talked about of our depreciation and amortization. So we expect mid-to-high-single digit EPS growth in 2019, with a low double-digit growth in 2020 and 2021."
0,"The net operating loss carry-forwards expires in 2037 and may be subject to annual limitations. We ended the fourth quarter of 2017 with a stable balance sheet, no debt, a record backlog of $77 million and a project pipeline in excess of $250 million, positioning SG Blocks for significant financial performance in 2018 and beyond. I'll now turn the call back over to Paul."
0,"The schizophrenia advocacy program includes two positive randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and supportive data from a third study, all three conducted in the United States. Last year, we completed the first part of our open label safety switching study in stable patients with schizophrenia and topline data demonstrating the safety of lumateperone in a real world setting represented at the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology Meeting held in December 2017. This study extends our understanding of the safety and effectiveness of lumateperone."
0,"The second aspect is premature treatment discontinuation in both treatment arms. And the third aspect is that presumably for patients who got very low LDL cholesterol levels or because of intolerance, these patients of whom the overwhelming majority were exposed for the first time to statins at the time of their ACS in contrast to FOURIER where they were stable on a stable statin therapy. Many of these patients may have lowered the intensity or stopped background statin therapy which explains the fact that the drift we're seeing on treatment for LDL cholesterol to go back up is seen in parallel in the treatment arm with alirocumab, but also in the placebo arm suggesting that discontinuation or down-titration of background statins in these patients newly exposed to statin may account for some of the apparent loss of LDL cholesterol-lowering properties."
0,"These payments, finalization of the full year incentive compensation accrual, resulted in lower overall compensation expense compared to the third quarter. On a year-to-date basis, G&A expense as a percentage of our equity was stable at approximately 1. 5%."
0,"These pillows have different profiles and construction, so each customer can find the perfect pillow fit. Completing the bedding system, we've also replaced our entire adjustable base portfolio. The portfolio is upgraded and streamlined, which greatly simplifies the supply chain for our retailer."
0,"They're really primarily growth-related issues that we had. First is in Adjustable Bed, where you saw our huge volume increases in the fourth quarter, and in some cases, we struggled just to get enough capacity to get those out the door. That led to some additional costs there."
0,"This is appropriate in a capital-intensive cyclical industry. This financial strength enables us to maintain a low-cost structure and strategic relationship with our service providers by funding a steady CapEx program; make commitments for low-cost services and supplies at opportunistic times, often when oil and gas prices are depressed; and similarly, make opportunistic acquisitions of acreage or other assets. We are very pleased that EOG weathered the industry downturn without an equity offering or cutting the dividend."
0,This is Steve. I think our   we expect stable credit. You can see how that's playing out in our reserve levels.
0,"through creating a second therapeutic area, focused in infectious disease ahead of obviously the launch of our SUBA-Itraconazole product. So, that's going to be our   other than driving growth with the foams, and having a stable Doryx sort of underpinning that. The only other element of growth that we're focused on organically right now is bringing what we think is going to be a very exciting infectious disease product to market in the U."
0,"Together with technology they can untether a worker from a dedicated space, businesses have used this disruption to fashion a workplace that shifts the balance of space allocation away from the individual even as that individual space is upgrade with more ergonomic performance and towards the group while simultaneously reducing the use of total real estate and looking for ways to reduce the cost of their fit-outs and furnishings. Our top line turnaround in the fourth quarter was driven in part by our active response to these trends with new hospitality-based products like Rockwell Unscripted, accelerating their ramp up with the strongest quarter to date and our expanded range of adjustable tables and benches continuing the climb. The success of our newer, immersive, experiential workplace models is one of the reasons we have returned to growth as these combined platforms on an incoming orders basis exceeded those of our legacy workstation and storage products in the fourth quarter."
0,We also invest a lot via the OpEx base. Has that accelerated in the second half or is it more or less stable year-on-year and have we seen most of it now that's for example if I look at your number of entity?
0,We are aggressively managing aging inventory in the field and we are pursuing increased lot share due to the momentum especially of our Towables businesses. Our Motorized turns in the field are up and our Towables turns are steady. We will keep a close eye on our own production output and the inventory levels that we carry ourselves.
0,"We ended the year with $414. 9 million of cash equivalents, investable securities on our balance sheet. This represents a reduction of cash of approximately $274."
0,"We had a great year in 2017 with market leading returns and we're able to showcase the strengths of our total return business model. After building up stable long-term flow by focusing on less volatile, cash rich quota share contracts and reserve covers, we plan to incrementally shift to more risk taking to improve our underwriting results. Recent cat events have contributed to some improvement in pricing and we're off to a strong start in 2018."
0,"We had great numbers on Jif, great numbers on fruit spreads. We continue to pour gas on Uncrustables. Okay?"

0,"We see the special cables going a little bit better, not very much. Unfortunately, we see the projects almost stable with our very limited growth, why? Because in 2017 we got â‚¬1 billion order book, the order book is sound, but there is no reasons or no short-term foreseen of a significant growth of the market."
0,"We'll seek to continue to grow our distribution in line with the growth in our underlying cash flows, seek to enhance the flexibility of our balance sheet as well as our access to liquidity, further reducing our floating rate debt exposure and lowering our overall debt-to-capital ratio. We'll continue to recycle capital out of stable, mature investments into higher yielding opportunities across both our core and opportunistic investment strategies, and repurchasing our own units should they continue to trade at a discount to intrinsic value. We'll maintain or increase the occupancy in our core operating businesses while capturing mark-to-market increases as leases roll over, and further advance and begin to monetize our maturing development pipeline."
0,"Well, keep in mind with the 360, part of our strategy is the attach of the adjustable bases, which drives the higher ARU overall and you're seeing that in our performance."
0,"We're encouraged by this development. Pro forma for acquisitions of Harbor and Sunshine, our loan portfolio improves to 36% floating rate, 24% adjustable and 40% fixed. At the end of 2014, our floating rate portfolio was 16% of loans."

0,"So last year, we guided 40% to 45%. Now, we feel confident of increasing that to 45% to 50%. And then, the amortization, as I said, approximately $310 million, and that's our guidance for the year."
0,"So please do not take it out of proportion that it won't influence long-term, short-term models in the wrong way. I do believe that in mid longer time perspective of two, three years, it will allow us to become very significant player also in Japan."
0,So those trends continue. We have   we feel confident that there's a recapture. I'd be remiss to say whether that's the full recapture or half of recapture or someone in between.
0,"So we have to be creative in how we do this. We think peak losses are in 2018, and so the option allows us to avoid most of the losses. Certainly, the losses for 2018, and we think that it gets better on a going-forward basis after that."
0,"So we're not bumping it all back a year, let me put it that way. But we are   as I say, there's probably more   there is more investment, maybe it allows us to make the investments that we are doing."
0,"So we're pleased with the final 2017 number. We feel confident in our 2018 financials as well. As I mentioned, the backlog, very high backlog."
0,"So we've always taken a balanced approach. As we see opportunities in acquisitions, we'll steer it there. I would give you   I guess, if I gave you a priority for our free cash flow in 2018, it's probably going to be to invest in ourselves."
0,"So what's nice about it is it hits almost every single channel that we do business in, which that breadth really helps our portfolio. It allows us to continue with the earnings power that we have."
0,"So, that's about half of our services business today. That allows us to move up the value stack. So the second area, about 30% of our services business is payment services."
0,"So, that's the long-term position which provides a really strong base for our operations. It also allows us to do much better production planning and scheduling so we have more optimum production lines. Should we expect fewer, large, lumpy orders?"
0,"So, the ITC has the fastest time line of any IP court. It allows us to take multiple respondents into one single case, so all of these people into one case. And the International Trade Commission will grant an exclusion order."
0,"So, there is a lot of work to be done on delivering good tenders and developing good solutions. We feel confident that we will win some of these. How many?"
0,"So, there's just different pieces of it. And I don't want to get into specific pieces from a competitive standpoint, that we feel confident that the gross margin decrease that we will see next year will be less than what we've seen in the fourth quarter."
0,"So, we do think we've got an advantage. I think the big thing for us that Grubhub allows us to do in the U. S."
0,"So, we see it as a great opportunity to drive our   to the model that we're talking about, getting to 40/20/20. And it certainly allows us to drive rapid gross   top line as well."
0,"So, we're very excited about it. We feel confident about our ability to deploy it into several applications and we feel confident that we're deploying it geographically. But that will be a 2018 exercise."
0,"So, when everything shows back up and we go to bolt it together, we know it's going to go together the correct way the first try. And that allows us to have a very competitive time to market for our products."
0,"Speaking further regarding our long-term effective tax rate, we also have seen an increase in earnings globally. This increase in earnings in certain jurisdictions will allow us to access net operating losses previously deemed unusable by U. S."
0,"That is 50 to 75 basis points because of the underlying commodity pressure, not 75 to 125 basis points in a more benign commodity environment. So we think we've been realistic, and we think we have the tools that will allow us to get there."
0,that we want to be in. So what that allows us to do is to be very opportunistic and disciplined in terms of growth. We don't have to grow.
0,That would be correct. And we feel confident about the $20 million and we also feel confident about the revenue that we guided as well.
0,"That's   our ultimate goal is trying to put together our acreage, which will allow us to drill longer laterals. We do it every day in the Bakken."
0,"That's a significant opportunity, now the market is depressed, right."
0,"That's a slight drag on 2018, but I would say nothing overly dramatic. Generally speaking, we feel confident in the $1. 4 billion."
0,"That's our goal and that's what we're going to accomplish. And that allows us to mitigate rate impacts in our capital plan. We've also moved away from the ratio of O&M to gross margin, mainly because of the tax reform."
0,"The regulated business is the CE Mark, waiting for CE Mark as well as FDA. With CE, it will allow us to be able to do what we call RoW, which is Rest of World. We do have a definite plan scheduled with that."
0,"The second is to pursue the broader indication for the chronic sinusitis trial. And all I say is that relative to those two areas, which are the significant use of capital in the next several years, we feel confident we're well-capitalized."
0,The third quarter was marked by the completion of the Montchevre acquisition. It allows us to broaden our presence in the U. S.
0,"The trainer which will be selected in the second quarter of 2018, two of the three applicants for that on the airplane level are flying the F404. So we feel confident when the trainer decision is made. We have a pretty good shot of probability for a win."
0,"There's some risk and we're watching closely. Over the long run, we feel confident that we're very well placed to navigate the transition."
0,This gives us a real advantage of scale and reach. It allows us to make compelling offers for both Shell businesses and the third parties we work with.
0,"We actually look for productivity gains. And that allows us to drive smart cost cutting. So, yeah, I think CHF 400 million is it."
0,We are a test and learn company. We've got a price optimization tool that allows us to look at elasticity and we will do just that.
0,"We are more alpha, we can be more selective. We have a smaller book and that allows us to expect higher growth rate   pace for the credit portfolio this year."
0,We feel confident we'll be around that 15%.
0,We have generated the preclinical data for the five combination dose actually for the continuous dose cohorts and the process is in place for FDA approval prior to the fourth combination dose. So we feel confident about that.
0,"We have quite a bit of cash trapped offshore. That will allow us to bring all that cash back. So, very positive from a Biogen perspective, for U."
0,"We increased our dividend 9% in 2017. And in 2018, subject to board approval, we intend to increase our dividend 15% to 18%, which will allow us to hit the high-end of our goal of distributing 30% to 35% of earnings to our shareholders. Okay."
0,We saw mid-single-digit volume growth in West Texas. The commission agent model allows us to continue to participate in the turnaround in growth in this area. Q4 wholesale volumes was 1.
0,"We want to maintain a conservative capital structure, so that's been important to us and will continue to be important. It gives us flexibility and allows us to be opportunistic, and we're kind of targeting like a 1 times to 1. 5 times debt-to-EBITDA."
0,"We're not putting it on our balance sheet or finding ways to not expense it. It's in the numbers, which allows us to generate that cash. It's real cash that we can then give out to you and our shareholders."
0,We've got a $200 million authorization. And sort of when we see opportunities that's probably what we'll do in terms of returning capital.
0,"What we need to do is combine that with the enablement to get a faster ramp, and also to look at the causes of attrition and stem the outflow of people. A combination of both of those things will allow us to get after the ramp just as fast as we can."
0,"When we take   the final thing, you can say, when we take these kind of decisions, we only   we always do it in partnership with the retailer, so that we feel confident that there is a support from the retailers and that they really want the service."
0,Yeah. It allows us to adequately address that fragmented part of the marketplace...
0,Yeah. So right now the guide that we feel confident in is net retrans in 2018 to be up low-single-digits and for 2019 to be up low-teen percent. So now that we've gotten through those still within the guidance that we gave.
0,"Yeah. So, certainly, we'll have data from the switch study that will allow us to potentially answer that question with data. So patients who have been on eculizumab in the past and then come in and then are randomized to receive ALXN1210 or eculizumab."
0,Yeah. We've got a process in place with the commission that allows us to do it over time. But we would expect it to be done pretty quickly.
0,"Yes. Yeah, we feel confident that we will see a gradual improvement in our assortment this year compared to last year. Yes."
0," 07) I keep there. Q&A around the guidance, around the prospects, around the long-term plan."
0," 34) and you also spent some time in the automotive supply base at IAC and at Lear if I understand, and we also have Craig Barber who is the Director of Investor Relations and Strategic Planning."
0, 36). So I recognize that your strategy under Marlin 2. 0 and 3.
0," 38), can you talk a bit about how the deal was sourced and if you've changed your strategy for the larger deals at all?"
0," 43) summary. In 2017, we consistently executed our strategy. We pursued our growth path."
0," 45) with your telco strategy plus the SAP system ride quite easily, putting that on top of the existing platform? Thanks."

0," Banks. I'll now turn the call over to Bruce Lee, Heartland's President, who will provide an overview on the company's strategic initiatives. Bruce?"
0," But I think the key issue there, David, is no change in our capital allocation strategy."
0," But in hard luggage, I think Safari has become pretty aggressive when you look at the new range that they've launched in 2017, 2018. So what's your strategy to tackle this increased competitive intensity?"
0," By the sound of it, it's completed. Can you just talk about some of the implementation timing around that strategic plan and is there any cost associated with that? And maybe a little bit more color."
0," Chai, we have Mr. Kwek Eik Sheng, our Group Chief Strategy Officer; and nearer to me and next to Mr. Sherman Kwek is Ms."
0, Dr. Belloni will open the presentation with some remarks regarding our planned merger with Praxair then followed by highlights from our 2017 results and a progress update on our strategic plan. Dr.
0," Hey, thanks for the question. On fedratinib, could you expound on what your filing strategy is? Would you be filing for a broad label or for treatment experience label?"
0," Hi, guys. In the past conference call, you mentioned you guys weren't looking at current strategic initiatives, is that still the case?"
0," I have a general question. So we see that your strategy in FinTech is quite successful, there are   something like 430 FinTech's in the Netherlands, we have a good base to choose from. The question is more big tech."
0, I have three questions if I may. The first one is about your strategy for AWT in the next couple of years. You are going to spend some CapEx to integrate your business downstream.
0," If large project coming up, of course, we support our customers, but we will not go broaden the market with power. That is not our strategy. But, obviously, for big projects we make exceptions and take the revenue, yeah."
0," If you look at the biggest glass company in India, it's way, way, way smaller than what you'd find in Europe given the population size of India, for example. So we're very clear on what   our strategy remains the same as before. U."
0," I'm pleased to introduce MiMedx today. From the company we have Pete Petit Chairman and CEO; Chris Cashman Chief Commercialization Officer; and Mark Landy, Senior Vice President of Strategic Initiatives."
0," It's year by year. Of course, the strategic plan and the financial plan, it's longer than a year, but the actual target is based on a yearly basis."
0," Looking at the next page if I can get to it, there we go. Looking at our strategic priorities for 2017. 2017 was a good year, but it's not just about the fact that the year was pretty good."
0," Maybe just lastly, comment a bit on your acquisition strategy."
0," Next up, Steve Barnhart, our brand new CFO. Steve, with all of your long-term experience with FTD, do you have the cash flow, personally, does FTD have the cash flow to fund this   the strategic plan internally or will you borrow to fund the plan?"

0," Okay. And then, what is SIR's long-term plans with the ILPT shares?"

0," Robert Drake, Group CFO; Mr. Roland To, Senior Director of Strategic Planning; and Mr. Peter Caveny, Assistant Senior Vice President of Investor Relations."
0," S. food testing market, the largest in the world, and a critical market for our AFL strategy. At the end of 2017, the SGS Group had over 95,000 employees and 2,400 locations around the globe."
0," S. if you could just talk about your objectives there, what should we be expecting to see in Nielsen? What's the picture of success?"
0," So now that one of your peers is making that significant acquisition, your balance sheet has its lowest leverage profile of the group. How do you view your overall capitalization within context of your capital deployment strategy?"
0, So these are totally in line with our strategic priorities. These are more top priorities specifically for 2018.
0," So, CapEx, between $40 million and $47 million. Free cash, between $25 million and $33 million, which is in line with the strategic plan. So, there is the guidance."

0," Thanks, Keith. Now, I'd like to summarize our strategy. So, please refer to slide 18."
0," Thanks. And just as a follow-up, maybe you can just discuss your strategic priorities a little bit. There was limited buyback activity, it appears, in Q4, and Thomas mentioned M&A."
0," The only thing I would add to that is that as we have said in our long-term plan, we will be very active in managing our portfolio. And that means not only doing JVs with existing assets that we have but also looking for new assets."
0," The quarter was quite heavy on CapEx. So, where the CapEx is going now and how does that fit with your strategy with WBS or Rain deal?"
